        <p>Ibexa DXP's Public PHP API is defined in the Ibexa\Contracts namespace where consumption backward compatibility is promised.</p>

        <p>If those Contracts are used for type hinting (including auto-wiring), the received objects will always respect the Contracts in the next minor versions, following <a href="https://semver.org/">SemVer</a>.</p>
