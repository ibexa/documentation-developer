# How to contribute

Are you ready to become a part of the eZ Community? There are several ways in which you can contribute, from spotting and reporting bugs to committing to the documentation to discussing innovative uses on Slack to coding new bundles.

If you're looking to contribute code, whether in form of corrections or separate bundles with features, the open-source nature of eZ Platform lets you do this without any fuss using GitHub. Take a look at our [Development guidelines](development_guidelines.md) to get started.

If you've noticed any improvement needed in the documentation, see how to [Contribute to Documentation](#contribute-to-documentation).

If you'd just like to let us know of a bug you've encountered, see how to report it in [Report and follow issues](report_follow_issues.md).

If you'd like to contribute to a translation of eZ Platform interface, see [Contributing translations](translations.md).

If what you're looking for is simply discussing the way you use eZ Platform, drop by to the [community website](http://share.ez.no) or the [eZ Community Slack team](https://ezcommunity.slack.com/).
