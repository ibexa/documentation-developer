# How to Contribute

Are you ready to become a part of the eZ Community? There are several ways in which you can contribute, from spotting and reporting bugs to committing to the documentation to discussing innovative uses on Slack to coding new bundles.

If you're looking to contribute code, whether in form of corrections or separate bundles with features, the open-source nature of eZ Platform lets you do this without any fuss using GitHub. Take a look at our [Development guidelines](development_guidelines.md) to get started.

- [Contribute code](code.md) if you've fixed a bug or implemented improvement/feature

- [Contribute to documentation](documentation.md) if you've noticed any improvement needed in the documentation

- [Report and follow issues](report_follow_issues.md) if you'd just like to let us know of a bug you've encountered

- [Contribute translations](translations.md) if you'd like to add a translation of eZ Platform interface

- Visit [Community website](http://share.ez.no) or the [eZ Community Slack team](https://ezcommunity.slack.com/) if what you're looking for is simply discussing the way you use eZ Platform
