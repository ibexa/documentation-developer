# How to contribute

Are you ready to become a part of the Ibexa Community? There are several ways in which you can contribute, from spotting and reporting bugs to committing to the documentation to discussing innovative uses on Slack to coding new bundles.

If you're looking to contribute code, whether in a form of corrections or separate bundles with features, Ibexa OSS, [[= product_name =]]'s open-source version, lets you do this without any fuss by using GitHub. 
Take a look at our [Development guidelines](development_guidelines.md) to get started.

- [Report and follow issues](report_follow_issues.md) if you'd just like to let us know of a bug you've encountered

- [Contribute code](code.md) if you've fixed a bug or implemented improvement/feature

- [Contribute translations](translations.md) if you'd like to add a translation of [[= product_name =]] interface

- [Contribute to documentation](documentation.md) if you've noticed any improvement needed in the documentation

- Visit [Community website](http://share.ez.no) or the [eZ Community Slack team](https://ezcommunity.slack.com/) if what you're looking for is simply discussing the way you use [[= product_name =]]
