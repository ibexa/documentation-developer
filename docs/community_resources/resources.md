### Let's Connect!

In the course of its development eZ Platform has been deeply rooted in its community. This remains true, with many invaluable contributions by dedicated community members who play a key role in the continuous development of eZ Platform. 

eZ partners, customers, independent developers, designers, and digital content enthusiasts can contribute to important web projects, influence the [eZ roadmap](https://doc.ez.no/display/MAIN/eZ+Platform+Release+Process+and+Roadmap), and ensure the platform stays on top of market trends and organizations' needs.
