# Contribute translations

If you'd like to see [[= product_name =]] in your language, you can contribute to the translations.

[`ibexa-i18n`](https://github.com/ibexa/i18n) contains the XLIFF files providing translations under a `/translations` directory.
You can use an XLIFF editor of your choice to contribute strings in your language.

## Translating interface using Crowdin

If you wish to contribute to an existing translation of Back Office or start a new one you can
use the Crowdin website.

Visit [[[= product_name =]]'s Crowdin page](https://crowdin.com/project/ibexa-dxp), choose a language, and you will see a list of files containing strings. Here you can suggest your translations.

If the language you want to translate to is not available, you can ask for it to be added in the [Crowdin discussion forum for [[= product_name =]]](https://crowdin.com/project/ibexa-dxp/discussions).

Crowdin then automatically creates a GitHub PR and the translations are updated in the product.
