# Limitation reference

## Blocking limitation

A generic limitation type to use when no other limitation has been implemented.
Without any limitation assigned, a `LimitationNotFoundException` is thrown.

It's called "blocking" because it always informs the permissions system that the user doesn't have access to any policy the limitation is assigned to, making the permissions system move on to the next policy.

### Possible values

|Value|UI value|Description|
|------|------|------|
|`<mixed>`|`<mixed>`|This is a generic limitation which doesn't validate the values provided to it. Make sure that you validate the values passed to this limitation in your own logic.|

### Configuration

As this is a generic limitation, you can configure your custom limitations to use it.
Out of the box FunctionList uses it in the following way:

``` yaml
    # FunctionList is an ezjscore limitation, it only applies to ezjscore policies not used by
    # API/platform stack, so configure to use Blocking limitation to avoid LimitationNotFoundException
    ibexa.api.role.limitation_type.function_list:
        class: Ibexa\Core\Limitation\BlockingLimitationType
        arguments: ['FunctionList']
        tags:
            - {name: ibexa.permissions.limitation_type, alias: FunctionList}
```

## ActivityLogOwner limitation

The `ActivityLogOwner` limitation specifies if a user can see only their own [recent activity](recent_activity.md) log entries, and not entries from other users.

This limitation combined with `ContentType` limitation allows you to define business rules like allowing users to create "Blog Post" within a "Blog."
If you also combine it with `Owner of Parent` limitation, you effectively limit access to create Blog Posts in the users' own Blogs.
