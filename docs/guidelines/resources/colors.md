# Colors

Visual hierarchy and differentiation. We prioritize Create and Edit content as main functions in our CMS with orange color. Because most of the application has soft colors, color stands out and catches user's attention. We also define secondary, neutral and negative colors. Despite of this, it is also important to remind to not always rely on color to provide visual differentiation. If too many colors are employed, colors might lose their meaning.
