# User Interface Guidelines

<div class="mgt-3 mgb-1">This is a resource for developers, product managers, and designers, providing a unified language to build and customize eZ Platform admin user interface (aka Platform UI). We use it to simplify how we can build and offer a consistent interface across our content management platform.</div>

eZâ€™s UI Guidelines provides a simplified and recognizable experience; increases our productivity, enabling us to evolve faster; and it allows us to develop collectively.

This is an open source project. This is as much your tool as it is ours, and we look forward to collaborating with developers and partners on making it even better.
