# <div class="header-h1 mgb-0">User Interface Guidelines</div>

This is a resource for developers, product managers, and designers, providing a unified language to build and customize eZ Platform admin user interface (aka Admin UI). We use it to simplify how we can build and offer a consistent interface across our content management platform.

This section provides information about the specific User Interface components and resources that eZ Platform is using:

- If you're interested in how to add a specific component, check them out under **Components**.
- For design aspects, you'll find under **Resources** the three main ones we are using: [Typography](resources/typography.md), [Colors](resources/colors.md) and [Icons](resources/icons.md)
- Last but not least, take a look at our **Design Principles** in case you want to know the [Accessibility standards](design_principles/Accessibility.md) we are applying.
