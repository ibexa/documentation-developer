# Philosophy

The design philosophy underpins everything we do as a Product and Engineering Teams. It informs the way our products look, the way they behave and the way we work as a team.

### Modern

We design and build a new generation of content management software. This has been the result of marathon 3 years of collaboration.

### Simple

Our interface is the result of our vision: to deliver tools that simplify the way people — developers, designers, editors and marketers — interact with content.

### Content-centric

eZ's content engine provides a solid mechanism to reuse content. Across channels and contexts, users can easily repackage content for simple integration, and continuous optimization.

### Multi - Platform / Channel / Language

A flexible UI that accounts for different languages as well as format time and date conventions to support global variations.

### Expert / Beginner

To keep our focus on improving the experience of who ever uses eZ, from developers and designers to content editors, marketers and end users.

### Flexible

Opportunities for customization are limitless, so customers that use eZ are well positioned to continually adapt to their end users' ever-changing needs.

### User-centered

The experience must be personal and adapt to the constantly changing expectations of the end user. A great experience enhances the efficiency of any project.
