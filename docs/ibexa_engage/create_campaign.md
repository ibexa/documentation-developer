# Create campaign

[Campaign]([[= user_doc =]]/ibexa_engage/ibexa_engage/#campaign) is a set of concepts, divided into steps, that the user can configure.
It includes a welcome screen, an interaction element, a form step, and an exit screen.
Design, themes, backgrounds are all configured by Qualifio.

Technically, each campaign has a unique campaign ID, that is automatically defined by the Qualifio platform when it is created.

## Publication channels

Every campaign includes a minimum of one publication channel that you can choose from the three options the platform provides for publishing a campaign.
For more information about publication channels, see [Publication channel]([[= user_doc =]]/ibexa_engage/ibexa_engage/#publication-channel) in the User Documentation.

## Add block in Page Builder

You can add [Campaign block]([[= user_doc =]]/content_management/block_reference/#campaign-block) in Page Builder.
To add the campaign,  go to **Properties** tab -> **Campaign** and choose campaign from the drop-down list. This list includes all campaigns available on user's Qualifio account which are active or scheduled to launch in the future.
