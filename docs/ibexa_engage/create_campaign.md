# Create campaign

[Campaign]([[= user_doc =]]/ibexa_engage/ibexa_engage/#campaign) is a set of concepts, divided into steps, that the user can configure.
It can contain a welcome screen, an interaction element, a form step, an exit screen, and so on.
To create new campaign, you need to use Qualifio Manager.
You can use Qualifio's existing templates and interactive elements, such as quizzes, pools, and forms, to create visually appealing, customized campaigns.
Users can configure the backgrounds, themes, or designs, and set up a specific time frame for each campaign.

Technically, each campaign has a unique campaign ID, that is automatically defined by the Qualifio platform when it is created.

For more information about creating and managing campaigns, see [Qualifio documentation](https://support.qualifio.com/hc/en-us/categories/202280638-Campaigns).

## Publication channels

Each campaign includes a minimum of one publication channel that you can choose from the three options the platform provides for publishing a campaign.
For more information about publication channels, see [Publication channel]([[= user_doc =]]/ibexa_engage/ibexa_engage/#publication-channel) in the User Documentation.

## Use Campaign block in Page Builder

You can add [Campaign block]([[= user_doc =]]/content_management/block_reference/#campaign-block) in Page Builder to display campaign on the Landing Page.

To select campaign, go to **Properties** tab -> **Campaign** and choose campaign from the drop-down list. This list includes all campaigns available on user's Qualifio account which are active or scheduled to launch in the future.
