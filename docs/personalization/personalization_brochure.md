# Personalization product guide

## What is Personalization

Personalization engine is a cloud-based service that tracks and analyzes customer behaviors and delivers optimized, user-tailored content, and information.

The engine uses artificial intelligence and machine learning modeling to learn and create behavioral patterns and generate recommendations ready to be presented on one or more websites hosted by the [[= product_name =]] instance.

## Availability

Personalization service is available in all supported [[= product_name =]] versions and editions.

Pricing is based on the number of Personalization API events.

To enable recommendation engine, request access to the service by [creating an account]([[= user_doc =]]/personalization/enable_personalization/#request-access-to-the-server).

After setting up an account and receiving credentials, pass them to your administrator who can configure Personalization service in your [[= product_name =]] instance.

Now, you can start collecting data and boost your business.

## How does Personalization work


![How it works](how_perso_works.png)


Personalization with tracking scripts, monitors  individual sessions from user’s behavior and interest data through events (clicks, viewed articles, pages, purchases) and demographic data (location, industry, occupation).

Next, collects data and computes models thanks to complex algorithms. 

Personalization is SiteAcces-aware, it means it can serve on multiple sites with different customer IDs and deliver recommendations for each site (for example, if you host multi language site).

Use Twig extension to add a tracking script and implement it into your site configuration.

## Capabilities
