# Personalization

Ibexa Personalization is a service that allows you to track the visitors of your website and offers personalized recommendations or serves targeted content, based on their preferences and behavior.

Personalization can be used both by publishers, for example, to track content consumption 
and promote content, and in e-commerce, to drive purchases.

To provide online recommendations, the service must at least:

- Track user actions through a web browser or a mobile app
- Store the user actions
- Use the data to generate recommendations
- Provide recommendations on a customer's website
