# Track events with ibexa-tracker.js

This is another example of how you can integrate the tracking with a Google-style JavaScript in your site.
The approach is very generic and evaluate it if it meets your **requirements and security policy**.

If you want the `userid` to be generated automatically, set user parameter as empty `''` in the `_ycq.push` calls.
If a predefined cookie already exists, it is used.

Otherwise a new one is created.

## Tracking code quickstart

The Personalization JavaScript is a Google-like tracking API (ga.js) that you can paste into your pages.
It activates the tracking by inserting <https://cdn.perso.ibexa.co/ibexa-tracker.js> or <https://cdn.perso.ibexa.co/ibexa-tracker.min.js> into the page.

To use this mechanism on your pages, copy the code snippet below, and replace:

- `<YOUR_MANDATOR_ID>` with the customer ID
- `<CONTENT_TYPE_ID>` with the content type ID
- `<CONTENT_ID>` with the content item ID
- `<USER_ID>` with an empty string for cookie based anonymous user or with the value generated by your user identifier system for logged-in user. In case user activity should not be tracked, 'not_defined' value should be used to still have an event stored without a link to the user.

All identifiers can be any form of string.
Paste this snippet into your website template page so that it appears before the closing `</head>` tag.

``` js
<script type="text/javascript">
  var _ycq = _ycq || [];
  _ycq.push(['_setMandator', '<YOUR_MANDATOR_ID>']);
  _ycq.push(['_trackEvent', '<CONTENT_TYPE_ID>', 'click', '<CONTENT_ID>', '<USER_ID>']);

  (function() {
    var yc = document.createElement('script');
    yc.type = 'text/javascript';
    yc.async = true;
    yc.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://' : 'http://') + 'cdn.perso.ibexa.co/ibexa-tracker.min.js';
    var ycs = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
    ycs.parentNode.insertBefore(yc, ycs);
  })();

</script>
```

## Asynchronous syntax

The `_ycq` object is what makes the asynchronous syntax possible.
It acts as a queue, which is a "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) data structure that collects API calls until `ibexa-tracker.js` is ready to run them.
To add to the queue, use the `_ycq.push` method.

To push an API call into the queue, you must convert it from the traditional JavaScript syntax to a command array.
Command arrays are JavaScript arrays that conform to a certain format.
The first element in a command array is the name of the tracker object method that you want to call.
It must be a string. The remaining elements are the arguments you want to pass to the tracker object method.
These can be any JavaScript value.

## Tracking code

The `_ycq` global object can be used directly for asynchronous page tracking with the `push(...)` method. 

### `_ycq` object methods

#### push

`push(commandArray)`

Executes the command array, which is a JavaScript array that conforms to the following format. 
The first element of the array must be the name of a tracker object method passed as a string. 
The rest of the array elements are the values to be passed in as arguments to the function. 

Here is an example of typical usage of the method:

``` js
var _ycq = _ycq || [];
_ycq.push(['_setMandator', '<YOUR_MANDATOR_ID>']);
_ycq.push(['_trackEvent', '1', 'click', '10', '']);
```

## Tracker object names

| Object          | Description   | Example |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| `_setMandator ` | - Executed with one additional parameter: `MandatorId` | `_ycq.push (['_setMandator' , '<YOUR_MANDATOR_ID>']);` |
| `_trackEvent` | - Executed with four additional parameters: `ItemType`, `EventType`, `ItemId`, `UserId`.<br /> - `EventType` can be any of the [described types]([[= user_doc =]]/personalization/event_types/) | capturing an event: `_ycq.push(['_trackEvent', '1', 'buy', '10', '']);` |
| `_trackTimedEvent` | - Executed with five additional parameters: `ItemType`, `EventType`, `ItemId`, `Timeout`, `UserId`.<br /> - `EventType` can be any of the [described types]([[= user_doc =]]/personalization/event_types/).<br /> - `Timeout` can be any integer greater than 0 representing time in ms | consume event sent after 20s: `_ycq.push(['_trackTimedEvent', '1', 'consume', '10', '20000', '']);` |
| `_login` | - Executed with two additional parameters: anonymous userId, pseudonymous userId.<br /> - It is to be triggered when a user logs in and the tracking identity is changed.<br /> | - |
| `ycreco=true` | - If you want to send a click recommended event you can append the following parameter to the recommended item URLs: | [https://mydomain.com/mypage.html?ycreco=true](https://mydomain.com/mypage.html?ycreco=true) or <br />[https://mydomain.com/mypage.html?myparameter=x&ycreco=true](https://mydomain.com/mypage.html?myparameter=x&ycreco=true) |

## Tracking with HTML event handlers

The asynchronous tracking syntax should also be used from within DOM event handlers.
For example, the following button generates an event when it's clicked:

``` js
<button onclick = "_ycq.push(['_trackEvent', '2', 'click', 'itemId1', ''])"/><button>
```

Even if this button is clicked before the browser has finished loading `ibexa-tracker.js`, the event is captured and eventually executed.
