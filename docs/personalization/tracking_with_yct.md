# Track events with yct.js

This is another example of how you can integrate the tracking with a Google-style 
JavaScript in your site.
The approach is very generic and evaluate it if it meets your
**requirements and security policy**.

If you want the `userid` to be generated automatically, leave out the user 
params in the `_ycq.push` calls.
If a predefined cookie already exists, it is used. 
Otherwise a new one is created.

## Tracking code quickstart

The Personalization JavaScript is a Google-like tracking API (ga.js) that you can paste 
into your pages. 
It activates the tracking by inserting <https://cdn.perso.ibexa.co/ibexa-tracker.js> 
into the page.

To use this mechanism on your pages, copy the code snippet below, and replace 
`<YOUR_MANDATOR_ID>` with the customer ID, `<PAGE_ID>` with the page/item identifier 
and `<USER_ID>` with the one generated by your user identifier. 
All identifiers can be any form of string. 
Paste this snippet into your website template page so that it appears before 
the closing `</head>` tag.

``` js
<script type="text/javascript">
  var _ycq = _ycq || [];
  _ycq.push(['_setMandator', '<YOUR_MANDATOR_ID>']);
  _ycq.push(['_trackEvent', '1', 'click', '<PAGE_ID>', '<USER_ID>']);

  (function() {
    var yc = document.createElement('script'); 
    yc.type = 'text/javascript'; 
    yc.async = true;
    yc.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://' : 'http://') + 'cdn.perso.ibexa.co/ibexa-tracker.js';
    var ycs = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
    ycs.parentNode.insertBefore(yc, ycs);
  })();

</script>
```

## Asynchronous syntax

The `_ycq` object is what makes the asynchronous syntax possible. 
It acts as a queue, which is a "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) data structure that 
collects API calls until `yct.js` is ready to run them. 
To add to the queue, use the `_ycq.push` method.

To push an API call into the queue, you must convert it from the traditional 
JavaScript syntax to a command array. 
Command arrays are JavaScript arrays that conform to a certain format. 
The first element in a command array is the name of the tracker object method 
that you want to call. 
It must be a string. The remaining elements are the arguments you want to pass 
to the tracker object method. 
These can be any JavaScript value.

## Tracking code

The `_ycq` global object can be used directly for asynchronous page tracking 
with the `push(...)` method. 

### `_ycq` object methods

#### push

`push(commandArray)`

Executes the command array, which is a JavaScript array that conforms 
to the following format. 
The first element of the array must be the name of a tracker object method passed 
as a string. 
The rest of the array elements are the values to be passed in as arguments to 
the function. 

Here is an example of typical usage of the method:

``` js
var _ycq = _ycq || [];
_ycq.push(['_setMandator', '<YOUR_MANDATOR_ID>']);
_ycq.push(['_trackEvent', '1', 'click', 'https://mydoc.pdf', 'user1234']);
```

## Tracker object names

| Object          | Description   | Example  |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| `_setMandator ` | - Executed with one additional parameter: `MandatorId` | `_ycq.push (['_setMandator' , '<YOUR_MANDATOR_ID>']);` |
| `_trackEvent` | - Executed with four additional parameters: `ItemType`, `EventType`, `ItemId`, `UserId`.<br /> - `EventType` can be any of the [described types]([[= user_doc =]]/personalization/event_types/) |  capturing an event: `_ycq.push(['_trackEvent', '1', 'buy', 'https://mydoc.pdf', 'user1234x']);` |
| `_trackTimedEvent` | - Executed with five additional parameters: `ItemType`, `EventType`, `ItemId`, `Timeout`, `UserId`.<br /> - `EventType` can be any of the [described types]([[= user_doc =]]/personalization/event_types/).<br /> - `Timeout` can be any integer greater than than 0 representing time in ms | consume event sent after 20s: `_ycq.push(['_trackTimedEvent', '1', 'consume', 'https://mydoc.pdf', '20000', 'user1234x']);` |
| `_login` | - Executed with two additional parameters: anonymous userId, pseudonymous userId.<br /> - It is to be triggered when a user logs in and the tracking identity is changed.<br /> |-|
| `ycreco=true` | - If you want to send a click recommended event you can append the following parameter to the recommended item URLs: | [https://mydomain.com/mypage.html?ycreco=true](https://mydomain.com/mypage.html?ycreco=true) or <br />[https://mydomain.com/mypage.html?myparameter=x&ycreco=true](https://mydomain.com/mypage.html?myparameter=x&ycreco=true) |

## Tracking with HTML event handlers

The asynchronous tracking syntax should also be used from within DOM event handlers. 
For example, the following button generates an event when it is clicked:

``` js
<button onclick = "_ycq.push(['_trackEvent', '2', 'click', 'itemId1', 'user1234x'])"/><button>
```

Even if this button is clicked before the browser has finished loading `yct.js`, 
the event is captured and eventually executed.
