description: Update your installation to the latest v4.6 version from v4.5.x.

# Update from v4.5.x to v4.6

This update procedure applies if you are using a v4.5 installation.

## Update from v4.5.x to v4.5.latest

Before you update to v4.6, you need to go through the following steps to update to the latest maintenance release of v4.5 (v[[= latest_tag_4_5 =]]).

### Update the application to v4.5.latest

Run:

=== "[[= product_name_content =]]"

    ``` bash
    composer require ibexa/content:[[= latest_tag_4_5 =]] --with-all-dependencies --no-scripts
    ```
=== "[[= product_name_exp =]]"

    ``` bash
    composer require ibexa/experience:[[= latest_tag_4_5 =]] --with-all-dependencies --no-scripts
    ```
=== "[[= product_name_com =]]"

    ``` bash
    composer require ibexa/commerce:[[= latest_tag_4_5 =]] --with-all-dependencies --no-scripts
    ```

## Update from v4.5.latest to v4.6

When you have the latest version of v4.5, you can update to v4.6.

### Update the application

First, run:

__TODO: ibexa/headless requires different steps__

=== "[[= product_name_headless =]] (formerly [[= product_name_content =]])"

    ``` bash
    composer remove ibexa/content --no-update --no-scripts
    rm symfony.lock # Avoid recipes conflict between configuring ibexa/headless and unconfiguring ibexa/content
    composer require ibexa/headless:[[= latest_tag_4_6 =]] --with-all-dependencies --no-scripts
    composer recipes:install ibexa/headless --force -v
    ```
=== "[[= product_name_exp =]]"

    ``` bash
    composer require ibexa/experience:[[= latest_tag_4_6 =]] --with-all-dependencies --no-scripts
    composer recipes:install ibexa/experience --force -v
    ```
=== "[[= product_name_com =]]"

    ``` bash
    composer require ibexa/commerce:[[= latest_tag_4_6 =]] --with-all-dependencies --no-scripts
    composer recipes:install ibexa/commerce --force -v
    ```

The `recipes:install` command installs new YAML configuration files.
Review the old YAML files and move your custom configuration to the relevant new files.

## Finish code update

Finish the code update by running:

```bash
composer run post-install-cmd
```

### Update the database

Next, update the database:

[[% include 'snippets/update/db/db_backup_warning.md' %]]

Apply the following database update scripts:

=== "MySQL"

    ``` bash
    mysql -u <username> -p <password> <database_name> < vendor/ibexa/installer/upgrade/db/mysql/ibexa-4.5.latest-to-4.6.0.sql
    ```

=== "PostgreSQL"

    ``` bash
    psql <database_name> < vendor/ibexa/installer/upgrade/db/postgresql/ibexa-4.5.latest-to-4.6.0.sql
    ```

#### Update [[= product_name_com =]] database [[% include 'snippets/commerce_badge.md' %]]

For [[= product_name_com =]] installations, you also need to run:

=== "MySQL"

    ``` bash
    mysql -u <username> -p <password> <database_name> < vendor/ibexa/installer/upgrade/db/mysql/commerce/ibexa-4.5.latest-to-4.6.0.sql
    ```

=== "PostgreSQL"

    ``` bash
    psql <database_name> < vendor/ibexa/installer/upgrade/db/postgresql/commerce/ibexa-4.5.latest-to-4.6.0.sql
    ```

## Run data migration

### Dashboard [[% include 'snippets/experience_badge.md' %]] [[% include 'snippets/commerce_badge.md' %]]

If you are using [[= product_name_exp =]] or [[= product_name_com =]],
you must run data migration required by the dashboard and other features to finish the upgrade process:

```bash
php bin/console ibexa:migrations:import vendor/ibexa/dashboard/src/bundle/Resources/migrations/structure.yaml --name=2023_09_23_14_15_dashboard_structure.yaml
php bin/console ibexa:migrations:import vendor/ibexa/dashboard/src/bundle/Resources/migrations/permissions.yaml --name=2023_10_10_16_14_dashboard_permissions.yaml
php bin/console ibexa:migrations:migrate --file=2023_09_23_14_15_dashboard_structure.yaml --file=2023_10_10_16_14_dashboard_permissions.yaml
```

## Revisit mandatory configuration

### Dashboard [[% include 'snippets/experience_badge.md' %]] [[% include 'snippets/commerce_badge.md' %]]

Define "Dashboards" location as contextual tree root:

```yaml
ibexa:
    system:
        # ...
        admin_group:
            content_tree_module:
                contextual_tree_root_location_ids:
                    #...
                    - 67 # Dashboards (clean installation)
```

### User profile

Ibexa DXP v4.6 introduced user profile for Backoffice users, allowing to ...

This feature is optional, and you might disable it by setting `enabled` flag to `false` in `ibexa.system.<scope>.user_profile` configuration:

```yaml
# /config/packages/ibexa_admin_ui.yaml
ibexa:
    system:
        # ...
        admin_group:
            user_profile:
                enabled: false
```

In order to enable user profile, you need to se specify content type identifiers which are representing editor user and field groups that will be rendered in user profile summary:

```yaml
# /config/packages/ibexa_admin_ui.yaml
ibexa:
    system:
        # ...
        admin_group:
            user_profile:
                enabled: true
                content_types: ['editor']
                field_groups: ['about', 'contact']
```

You can use your own content type representing backoffice user or use default one provided by Ibexa DXP:

```bash
php bin/console ibexa:migrations:import vendor/ibexa/installer/src/bundle/Resources/install/migrations/2023_12_07_20_23_editor_content_type.yaml --name=2023_12_07_20_23_editor_content_type.yaml
php bin/console ibexa:migrations:import vendor/ibexa/installer/src/bundle/Resources/install/migrations/2024_01_09_22_23_editor_permissions.yaml --name=2024_01_09_22_23_editor_permissions.yaml
php bin/console ibexa:migrations:migrate --file=2023_12_07_20_23_editor_content_type.yaml --file=2024_01_09_22_23_editor_permissions.yaml
```

### Site Context

Site context is ...

Add non publicly accessible locations to the list of excluded paths:

```yaml
# /config/packages/ibexa_site_context.yaml
ibexa:
    system:
        # ...
        admin_group:
            site_context:
                excluded_paths:
                    - /1/5/     # Users
                    - /1/43/    # Media
                    - /1/55/    # Forms
                    - /1/56/    # Site skeletons
                    - /1/67/    # Dashboards
                    - /1/61/    # Product categorises
                    - /1/65/    # Corporate Account
                    - /1/57/    # Tags
```

## Revisit optional configuration

### Activity Log

By default, activity log keeps entries for 30 days. You can change this value by setting `ibexa.repositories.<name>.activity_log.truncate_after_days` parameter:

```yaml
ibexa:
    repositories:
        default:
            # ...
            activity_log:
                truncate_after_days: 10
```

## Revisit permissions

### Recent activity

"Activity Log / Read" policy (`activity_log/read`) should be added to every role having access to the Back Office, at least with the "Only own log" limitation.
This policy is mandatory to display the "Recent activity" block in [dashboards](#dashboard), and the "Recent activity" block in [user profiles](#user-profile). 

The following migration example allows `Editor` role to access own activity log:

```yaml
-   type: role
    mode: update
    match:
        field: identifier
        value: 'Editor'
    policies:
        mode: append
        list:
            - module: activity_log
              function: read
              limitations:
                  - identifier: activity_log_owner
                    values: []
```
