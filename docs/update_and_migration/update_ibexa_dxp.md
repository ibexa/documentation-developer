# Updating [[= product_name =]]

To update [[= product_name =]] to a newer version, select the version you're currently using:

=== "I am using v1.13 or v2.x"

    If you have a v1.13 installation, or a v2.x installation lower than the latest v2.5,
    [update to the v2.5 LTS](from_1.x_2.x/update_from_1.x_2.x.md).

    Afterwards, it's strongly recommended to [update to the v3.3 LTS](from_2.5/update_from_2.5.md) and then update to the latest LTS, [v4.6](from_4.5/update_from_4.5.md) (through [v4.0](from_3.3/to_4.0.md) up to v4.6).

=== "I am using v2.5"

    If you have a v2.5 installation, [update to the v3.3 LTS](from_2.5/update_from_2.5.md).

    Afterwards, it's strongly recommended to also update to the latest LTS, [v4.6](from_4.5/update_from_4.5.md) (through [v4.0](from_3.3/to_4.0.md) up to v4.6).

=== "I am using v3.3"

    If you already have a v3.3 installation, [update to the latest v3.3 version](from_3.3/update_from_3.3.md).

    Afterwards, it's strongly recommended to also update to the latest LTS, [v4.6](from_4.5/update_from_4.5.md) (through [v4.0](from_3.3/to_4.0.md) up to v4.6).
