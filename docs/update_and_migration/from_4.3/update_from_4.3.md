# Update from v4.3.x to v4.4

This update procedure applies if you are using the newest v4.3 installation.

There are two routs you can take.
The first one is for you, if you do not use old commerce packages, then you can proceed with removing them.
The second one is for you if you use commerce packages and would like to continue to use them, even though they have deprecated since v4.4.
