# Update from v4.3.x to v4.4

This update procedure applies if you are using the newest v4.3 installation.

In this release, we deprecated all commerce packages in Ibexa DXP and plan to remove them in v5.
Until that time, they will be maintained by Ibexa with fixes, including security fixes, but they won't be further developed.
Old packages are replaced by [the all-new Ibexa Commerce packages](ibexa_dxp_v4.4.md#all-new-ibexa-commerce-packages).

For that reason, there are two update routs you can take.
The first one is for you, if you do not use old commerce packages, then you can proceed with removing them.
The second one is for you if you do use commerce packages and would like to continue to use them for the time being.
