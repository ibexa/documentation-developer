# Update from v4.6.x to v4.6.latest

## Update the application

Note which version you actually have before starting.

First, run:

=== "[[= product_name_headless =]]"

    ``` bash
    composer require ibexa/headless:[[= latest_tag_4_6 =]] --with-all-dependencies --no-scripts
    composer recipes:install ibexa/headless --force -v
    ```
=== "[[= product_name_exp =]]"

    ``` bash
    composer require ibexa/experience:[[= latest_tag_4_6 =]] --with-all-dependencies --no-scripts
    composer recipes:install ibexa/experience --force -v
    ```
=== "[[= product_name_com =]]"

    ``` bash
    composer require ibexa/commerce:[[= latest_tag_4_6 =]] --with-all-dependencies --no-scripts
    composer recipes:install ibexa/commerce --force -v
    ```

Then execute the instructions below from the version you're upgrading from (or the closest superior) to the end of this page.

## v4.6.2

#### Database update

Run the following scripts:

=== "MySQL"

    ``` bash
    mysql -u <username> -p <password> <database_name> < vendor/ibexa/installer/upgrade/db/mysql/ibexa-4.6.1-to-4.6.2.sql
    ```

=== "PostgreSQL"

    ``` bash
    psql <database_name> < vendor/ibexa/installer/upgrade/db/postgresql/ibexa-4.6.1-to-4.6.2.sql
    ```

## v4.6.3

### Notification config update

The configuration of the package `ibexa/notifications` has changed.
This package is required by other packages, such as `ibexa/connector-actito` for [Transactional emails](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/commerce/transactional_emails/transactional_emails/), `ibexa/payment`, or `ibexa/user`.

If you are customizing the configuration of the `ibexa/notifications` package, and using SiteAccess aware configuration to change the `Notification` subscriptions, you have to manually change your configuration by using the new node name `notifier` instead of the old `notifications`.

For example, the following v4.6.2 config:

```yaml hl_lines="4"
ibexa:
    system:
        my_siteacces_name:
            notifications: # old
                subscriptions:
                    Ibexa\Contracts\Shipping\Notification\ShipmentStatusChange:
                        channels:
                            - sms
```

becomes the following from v4.6.3:

```yaml hl_lines="4"
ibexa:
    system:
        my_siteacces_name:
            notifier: # new
                subscriptions:
                    Ibexa\Contracts\Shipping\Notification\ShipmentStatusChange:
                        channels:
                            - sms
```

## v4.6.4

#### Database update

Run the following scripts:

=== "MySQL"

    ``` bash
    mysql -u <username> -p <password> <database_name> < vendor/ibexa/installer/upgrade/db/mysql/ibexa-4.6.3-to-4.6.4.sql
    ```

=== "PostgreSQL"

    ``` bash
    psql <database_name> < vendor/ibexa/installer/upgrade/db/postgresql/ibexa-4.6.3-to-4.6.4.sql
    ```

## v4.6.8

To avoid deprecations when updating from an older PHP version to PHP 8.2 or 8.3, run the following commands:

``` bash
composer config extra.runtime.error_handler "\\Ibexa\\Contracts\\Core\\MVC\\Symfony\\ErrorHandler\\Php82HideDeprecationsErrorHandler"
composer dump-autoload
```

## v4.6.9

No additional steps needed.

## v4.6.10

A command to deal with duplicated database entries, as reported in [IBX-8562](https://issues.ibexa.co/browse/IBX-8562), will be available soon.

## v4.6.11

### Ibexa Cloud

Update Platform.sh configuration for PHP and Varnish.

Generate new configuration with the following command:

```bash
composer ibexa:setup --platformsh
```

Review the changes applied to `.platform.app.yaml` and `.platform/`,
merge with your custom settings if needed, and commit them to Git.

## v4.6.12

If the new bundle `ibexa/core-search` has not been added by the recipies, enable it by adding the following line in `config/bundles.php`:

```php
    Ibexa\Bundle\CoreSearch\IbexaCoreSearchBundle::class => ['all' => true],
```
