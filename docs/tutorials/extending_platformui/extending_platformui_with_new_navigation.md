# Extending Platform UI with new navigation

## Introduction

This tutorial aims at providing a step-by-step guide on how to extend the JavaScript application provided by [the PlatformUI bundle](https://github.com/ezsystems/PlatformUIBundle). 

In this tutorial, we will create a new part of the application allowing you to browse your content by Content Type instead of using the tree structure. To fully benefit from this document, you need to:

- be comfortable with eZ Platform's content model (Content, Location, Content Type, etc.)
- have basic to intermediate level in HTML5/CSS/JavaScript
- have a basic knowledge of Symfony's concepts (Bundle, Controller and routing)
- have read the [PlatformUI technical introduction](../../guide/extending_ez_platform.md)

This tutorial is divided into 8 steps. The complete code base is available on GitHub in [the ExtendingPlatformUIConferenceBundle repository](https://github.com/ezsystems/ExtendingPlatformUIConferenceBundle) which also provides a tag for each step. The expected end result can be seen in [this screencast](https://youtu.be/qeww3XBj-is).
