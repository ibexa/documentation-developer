# Step 2 - Create the content model

How your content is structured is a very important part of an eZ Platform project. Think of it as the database design of your application.

To get full information, read the [content model](../../guide/content_model.md) documentation page.
Below is a short introduction that only covers points needed for this tutorial.

## Content model overview

The eZ Platform content Repository is centered around **Content items**. A Content item is a single piece of content, for example an article, a product review, a place, etc.

Every Content item is an instance of a **Content Type**. Content Types define what **Fields** are included in each Content item.
For example, an article could include Fields such as *title*, *image*, *abstract*, *article's body*, *publication date* and *list of authors*.

Fields can belong to one of the installed **Field Types**, about 30 in the default distribution.
Each Field Type is built to represent a specific type of data: a text line, a block of rich text, an image, a collection of relations to Content items, etc.
You can find a complete list in the [Field Types reference](../../api/field_type_reference.md) section.
Every Field Type may have its own options, and comes with its own editing and viewing interfaces.

## Create a Content Type

The site will use two Content Types: **Ride** and **Landmark**.
A Ride is a route of a bike trip. It can include one or more Landmarks - interesting places you can see along the way.
More than one Ride can visit the same Landmark, so it is similar to an N-N relationship model in a database.

In this step you'll create the first Content Type, Ride.

Go to the admin interface (`<yourdomain>/admin`) and log in with the default username: `admin` and the default password: `publish`. 

Go to **Admin** in the top bar and choose **Content Types** in the sub menu:

You will see a list of **Content Type Groups**. They are used to group Content Types in a logical way.

Select **Content** and then activate the plus icon.

Fill the form with this basic info: 

- **Name**: Ride
- **Identifier**: `ride`

Then create all Fields with the following information: 

| Field Type   | Name             | Identifier       |  Required | Searchable | Translatable |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Text line    | Name             | `name`           | yes       | yes        | yes          |
| Image Asset  | Photo            | `photo`          | no        | no         | no           |
| Rich Text    | Description      | `description`    | yes       | yes        | yes          |
| Map location | Starting point   | `starting_point` | yes       | yes        | no           |
| Map location | Ending point     | `ending_point`   | yes       | yes        | no           |
| Integer      | Length           | `length`         | yes       | yes        | no           |

Confirm the creation of the Content Type by selecting Save.

## Create Rides

Go back to the Content structure page by selecting Content in the top bar. Then browse the Content tree and create a Folder named *All Rides* using the **Create** button in the Action bar on the right of the screen. Publish the Folder.

While in the folder, create a few of Rides using the Create button, add photos and publish them.

Once you have two or more Rides in the Folder, you are ready to customize the homepage of the website.
