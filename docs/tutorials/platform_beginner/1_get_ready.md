# Step 1 - Get ready

To begin the tutorial, you need a clean installation of eZ Platform.

Get it by following the [install eZ Platform](../../getting_started/install_ez_platform.md) guide.
You will need a web server, a relational database and PHP.

!!! note "Installation type"

    When performing the `ezplatform:install` command, choose the `clean` installation type.

!!! tip

    You can use [the local PHP built-in web server](../../getting_started/install_ez_platform.md#use-phps-built-in-server) for this tutorial.

The clean installation contains only a root Content item which is displayed using a default template.
