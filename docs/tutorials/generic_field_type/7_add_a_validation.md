# Step 7 - Add basic validation

To provide basic validation that ensures both coordinates are provided, add assertions to the `src/FieldType/Point2D/Value.php`:

```php
[[= include_file('code_samples/field_types/2dpoint_ft/src/FieldType/Point2D/Value.php', 6, 23) =]]
// ...
```

As a result, if a user tries to publish the Point 2D with just one value, they will receive an error message.
