# Creating a Point 2D field type

This tutorial covers the creation and development of a custom [[= product_name =]] [field type](create_custom_generic_field_type.md).
The Generic field type is a powerful extension point.
It enables you to build complex solutions on a ready-to-go field type template.

Field types are responsible for:

- Storing data, either using the native storage engine mechanisms or specific means
- Validating input data
- Making the data searchable (if applicable)
- Displaying fields

For more information, see [field type documentation](field_types.md).
It describes how each component of a field type interacts with the various layers of the system, and how to implement them.

## Intended audience

This tutorial is aimed at developers who are familiar with [[= product_name =]] and are comfortable with operating in PHP and Symfony.

## Content of the tutorial

This tutorial shows you how to use the Generic field type as a template for a custom field type.
You:

- create a custom Point 2D field type with two coordinates as input, for example '4,5'
- register the new field type as a service and define its template
- add basic validation to your Point 2D
- add data migration to the field type so you're able to change its output

## Steps

In this tutorial you go through the following steps:

- [1. Implement the Point 2D Value class](1_implement_the_point2d_value_class.md)
- [2. Define the Point 2D field type](2_define_point2d_field_type.md)
- [3. Create form for editing field type](3_create_form_for_point2d.md)
- [4. Introduce a template](4_introduce_a_template.md)
- [5. Add a new Point 2D field](5_add_a_field.md)
- [6. Implement Point 2D settings](6_settings.md)
- [7. Add basic validation](7_add_a_validation.md)
- [8. Data migration between field type versions](8_data_migration.md)
