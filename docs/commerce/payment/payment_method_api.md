# Payment method API

To get payment methods and manage them, use the `Ibexa\Contracts\Payment\PaymentMethodServiceInterface` interface.

From the developer's perspective, payment methods are referenced with identifiers defined manually at method creation stage in user interface. 

## Get single payment method

### Get single payment method by identifier

To access a single payment method by using its string identifier, use the `PaymentMethodService::getPaymentMethodByIdentifier` method:

``` php
[[= include_file('code_samples/api/commerce/src/Command/PaymentMethodCommand.php', 52, 56) =]]
```

### Get single payment method by ID

To access a single payment method by using its numerical ID, use the `PaymentMethodService::getPaymentMethod` method:

``` php
[[= include_file('code_samples/api/commerce/src/Command/PaymentMethodCommand.php', 46, 50) =]]
```

## Get multiple payment methods

To fetch multiple payment methods, use the `PaymentMethodService::findPaymentMethods` method. 
It follows the same search query pattern as other APIs:

``` php
[[= include_file('code_samples/api/commerce/src/Command/PaymentMethodCommand.php', 58, 75) =]]
```

## Create payment method

To create a payment method, use the `PaymentMethodService::createPaymentMethod` method and provide it with 
an `Ibexa\Contracts\Payment\PaymentMethod\PaymentMethodCreateStruct` object that takes the following parameters: 
`identifier` string, `type` TypeInterface object, `names` array of string values, `descriptions` array of string values, `enabled` boolean value, and an `options` object.

``` php
[[= include_file('code_samples/api/commerce/src/Command/PaymentMethodCommand.php', 58, 59) =]][[= include_file('code_samples/api/commerce/src/Command/PaymentMethodCommand.php', 77, 87) =]]
```

## Update payment method

You can update the payment method after it is created. 
An `Ibexa\Contracts\Payment\PaymentMethod\PaymentMethodUpdateStruct` object can take the following arguments: `identifier` string, `names` array of string values, `descriptions` array of string values, `enabled` boolean value, and an `options` object.
To update payment method information, use the `PaymentMethodServiceInterface::updatePaymentMethod` method:

``` php
[[= include_file('code_samples/api/commerce/src/Command/PaymentMethodCommand.php', 89, 99) =]]
```

## Delete payment

To delete a payment method from the system, use the `PaymentMethodService::deletePayment` method:
``` php
[[= include_file('code_samples/api/commerce/src/Command/PaymentMethodCommand.php', 101, 109) =]]
```
