# Enable purchasing products

To enable purchasing from the catalog, the following configuration is required:

- at least [one region and one currency for the shop](#region-and-currency)
- [VAT rates for the product type](#vat-rates)
- at least [one price for the product](prices.md)
- [availability with positive or infinite stock for the product](catalog.md#product-availability-and-stock)

!!! tip "Product completeness"

    You can track required tasks related to product configuration in product view's **Completeness** tab.

    This page shows which tasks are finished for the given product, and which are still awaiting completion.

    Click the edit button next to an unfinished task to move directly to the screen where you can add the missing information.

## Region and currency

All currencies available in the system must be enabled in the Back Office under **Commerce** -> **Currencies**.

Additionally, you must configure currencies valid for specific SiteAccesses in configuration:

``` yaml
ibexa:
    system:
        shop:
            product_catalog:
                currencies:
                    - EUR
                    - USD
                regions:
                    - france
                    - germany
                    - norway
```

### Configuring other regions and currencies

By default, the system always uses the first currency and the first region configured.

To implement a different logic, for example a switcher for preferred currencies and regions,
you need to subscribe to `Ibexa\Contracts\ProductCatalog\Events\CurrencyResolveEvent`
and `Ibexa\Contracts\ProductCatalog\Events\RegionResolveEvent` in your customization.

## VAT rates

You set up VAT percentage values corresponding to VAT rates in configuration:

``` yaml
ibexa:
    repositories:
        shop:
            product_catalog:
                engine: default
                regions:
                    region_1:
                        vat_categories:
                            standard: 18
                            reduced: 6
                            none: ~
```

You can configure which VAT rate to use per product type in the Back Office.

In the product type editing mode, access the definition of the Product Specification Field.

## Product price

The product must have at least one [price](prices.md) configured.

## Product availability

To enable adding a product to basket, you must configure product [availability](catalog.md#product-availability-and-stock)
with positive or infinite stock.
