# Update database to v3.2

!!! caution "Before you proceed"

    When you are updating from a version prior to v3.1, you must implement all the changes [from v3.1](5_update_3.1.md) before you proceed to the steps below.

If you are using Ibexa DXP or Ibexa Commerce, apply one of the following database update scripts:

- for MySQL:

``` bash
mysql -u <username> -p <password> <database_name> < upgrade/db/mysql/ezplatform-3.1.0-to-3.2.0.sql
```

- for PostgreSQL:

``` bash
psql <database_name> < upgrade/db/postgresql/ezplatform-3.1.0-to-3.2.0.sql
```

## Updating to v3.2.6

To update to v3.2.6, if you are using MySQL, additionally run the following update script:

``` sql
mysql -u <username> -p <password> <database_name> < upgrade/db/mysql/ezplatform-3.2.5-to-3.2.6.sql
```

### Update entity managers

Version v3.2.6 introduces new entity managers.
To ensure that they work in multi-repository setups, you must update the GraphQL schema.
You do this manually by following this procedure:

1. Update your project to v3.2.6 and run the `php bin/console cache:clear` command to generate the [service container](../api/service_container.md).

1. Run the following command to discover the names of the new entity managers. 
    Take note of the names that you discover:

    `php bin/console debug:container --parameter=doctrine.entity_managers --format=json | grep ibexa_`

1. For every entity manager prefixed with `ibexa_`, run the following command:

    `php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --em=<ENTITY_MANAGER_NAME> --dump-sql`
  
1. Review the queries and ensure that there are no harmful changes that could affect your data.

1. For every entity manager prefixed with `ibexa_`, run the following command to run queries on the database:

    `php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --em=<ENTITY_MANAGER_NAME> --force`

### VCL configuration for Fastly

If you use Fastly, update your VCL configuration.

Locate the `vendor/ezsystems/ezplatform-http-cache-fastly/fastly/ez_main.vcl` file and add the following lines to it:

```
if (req.restarts == 0 && resp.status == 301 && req.http.x-fos-original-url) {
    set resp.http.location = regsub(resp.http.location, "/_fos_user_context_hash", req.http.x-fos-original-url);
}
```
