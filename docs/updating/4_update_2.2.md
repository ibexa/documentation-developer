# Updating from <2.2
    
If you are updating from a version prior to 1.13, you have to implement all the changes from [Updating from <1.13](4_update_1.13.md) before following the steps below.

!!! note

    During database update, you have to go through all the changes between your current version and your final version
    **e.g. during update from v2.2 to v2.5 you have to perform all the steps from: <2.3, <2.4 and <2.5**.
    Only after applying all changes your database will work properly.

## Change from UTF8 to UTF8MB4

Since v2.2 the character set for MySQL/MariaDB database tables changes from `utf8` to `utf8mb4` to support 4-byte characters.

To apply this change, use the following database update script:

``` bash
mysql -u <username> -p <password> <database_name> < vendor/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/data/update/mysql/dbupdate-7.1.0-to-7.2.0.sql
```

If you use DFS Cluster, also execute the following database update script:

``` bash
mysql -u <username> -p <password> <dfs_database_name> < vendor/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/data/update/mysql/dbupdate-7.1.0-to-7.2.0-dfs.sql
```

Be aware that these upgrade statements may fail due to index collisions.
This is because the indexes have been shortened, so duplicates may occur.
If that happens, you must remove the duplicates manually, and then repeat the statements that failed.

After successfully running those statements, change the character set and collation for each table, as described in [kernel upgrade documentation.](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/v7.2.4/doc/upgrade/7.2.md)

You should also change the character set that is specified in the application config:

In `app/config/config.yml`, set the following:

``` yml
doctrine:
    dbal:
        connections:
            default:
                charset: utf8mb4
```

Also make the corresponding change in `app/config/dfs/dfs.yml`.

## Page builder

!!! enterprise

    To update to v2.2, you need to run a script to add database tables for the Page Builder.
    You can find it in https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-ee-installer/blob/2.2/Resources/sql/schema.sql#L58

    When updating an Enterprise installation, you also need to run the following script due to changes in the `eznotification` table:

    ```
    ALTER TABLE `eznotification`
    CHANGE COLUMN `data` `data` BLOB NULL ;

    ALTER TABLE `eznotification`
    DROP INDEX `owner_id` ,
    ADD INDEX `eznotification_owner` (`owner_id` ASC);

    ALTER TABLE `eznotification`
    DROP INDEX `is_pending` ,
    ADD INDEX `eznotification_owner_is_pending` (`owner_id` ASC, `is_pending` ASC);
    ```

## Migrate Landing Pages

To update to v2.2 with existing Landing Pages, you need to use a dedicated script.
The script is contained in the `ezplatform-page-migration` bundle and **works since version v2.2.2**.
To use it:

1. Run `composer require ezsystems/ezplatform-page-migration`
2. Add the bundle to `app/AppKernel.php`: `new EzSystems\EzPlatformPageMigrationBundle\EzPlatformPageMigrationBundle(),`
3. Run command `bin/console ezplatform:page:migrate`

!!! tip

    This script will use the layout defined in your Landing Page.
    To migrate successfully, you need to copy your zone configuration
    from `ez_systems_landing_page_field_type` under `ezplatform_page_fieldtype` in the new config.
    Otherwise the script will encounter errors.


You can remove the bundle after the migration is complete.

The command will migrate Landing Pages created in eZ Platform 1.x, 2.0 and 2.1 to new Pages.
The operation is transactional and will roll back in case of errors.

If there are missing block definitions, such as Form Block or Schedule Block,
you have an option to continue, but migrated Landing Pages will come without those blocks.

!!! tip

    If you use different repositories with different SiteAccesses, use the `--siteaccess` switch
    to migrate them separately.

!!! tip

    You can use the `--dry-run` switch to test the migration.

After the migration is finished, you need to clear cache.

### Migrate custom blocks

For block types with custom storage you need to provide a dedicated converter but for simple blocks you can use `\EzSystems\EzPlatformPageMigration\Converter\AttributeConverter\DefaultConverter` as your service class.

You also need to redefine [YAML configuration](../guide/extending/extending_page.md#creating-page-blocks) for your custom blocks.

!!! caution

    Since v2.2 you no longer need to use services for custom Page Blocks, you can create them using YAML configuration.

The service definition has to be tagged as:

``` yaml
tags:
    - { name: ezplatform.fieldtype.ezlandingpage.migration.attribute.converter, block_type: my_block_type_identifier }
```

Custom converters must implement the `\EzSystems\EzPlatformPageMigration\Converter\AttributeConverter\ConverterInterface` interface.
`convert()` will parse XML `\DOMNode $node` and return an array of `\EzSystems\EzPlatformPageFieldType\FieldType\LandingPage\Model\Attribute` objects.

You can now follow the steps from [Updating from <2.3](4_update_2.3.md).
