# Update from v4.3.x to v4.4

This update procedure applies if you are using the newest v4.3 installation.

This release deprecates all Commerce packages in Ibexa DXP. They will be removed in v5.
Until that time, they will be maintained by Ibexa with fixes, including security fixes, but they won't be further developed.
Old packages are replaced by [the all-new Ibexa Commerce packages](ibexa_dxp_v4.4.md#all-new-ibexa-commerce-packages).

For that reason, there are two update routes you can take.

A. If you do not use Commerce functionalities, you can proceed with removing them.

B. If you use Commerce functionalities based on the deprecated packages, you can continue to use them for the time being.
