# Update from v4.3.x to v4.4

This update procedure applies if you are using the newest v4.3 installation.

This release deprecates all Commerce packages in [[= product_name =]]. They will be removed in v5.
Until that time, they will be maintained by [[= product_name_base =]] with fixes, including security fixes, but they won't be further developed.
Old packages are replaced by [the all-new Ibexa Commerce packages](ibexa_dxp_v4.4.md#all-new-ibexa-commerce-packages).

For that reason, there are two update routes you can take.

A. [If you do not use Commerce functionalities, you can proceed with removing them.](update_from_4.3_new_commerce.md)

B. [If you use Commerce functionalities based on the deprecated packages, you can continue to use them for the time being.](update_from_4.3_old_commerce.md)
