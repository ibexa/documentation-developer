# Ibexa DXP v4.6

**Version number**: v4.6

**Release date**: July 20, 2023

**Release type**: [LTS](https://support.ibexa.co/Public/service-life)

**Update**: [v4.5.x to v4.6](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/update_and_migration/from_4.5/update_from_4.5/)

## Notable changes

### Ibexa Headless

Ibexa Content changes name to Ibexa Headless to emphasize Ibexa's capacity for headless architecture.

The feature set and capabilities of the product remain the same.

### New features and improvements in Personalization

#### Email triggers

You can increase the engagement of your visitors and customers by delivering recommendations straight to their mailboxes. 
The feature requires that you expose an endpoint that passes data to an internal mailing system and supports the following two use cases:

- Inducing a purchase by pushing a message with cart contents or equivalents, when the customer's cart status remains unchanged for a set time.

- Inviting a visitor to come back to the site by pushing a message with recommendations, when the customer hasn't returned to the site for a set time.

For more information, see [Email triggers](https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/4.5/personalization/triggers.md).

#### Multiple attributes in recommendation computation

With this feature, you get an option to combine several attribute types when computing recommendations. 
As a result, users can be presented with recommendations from an intersection of submodel results.

For more information, see [Submodel parameters](recommendation_api.md#submodel-parameters) and [Submodels]https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/latest/personalization/recommendation_models/#submodels).

#### New scenario filter

Depending on a setting that you make when defining a scenario, the recommendation response can now include either product variants or base products only. 
This way you can deliver more accurate recommendations and avoid showing multiple variants of the same product to the client.

For more information, see [Commerce-specific filters](https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/latest/personalization/filters/#commerce-specific-filters).

###  New features and improvements in Commerce [[% include 'snippets/commerce_badge.md' %]]

#### Reorder

With the new Reorder feature, customers can effortlessly repurchase previously bought items
directly from their order history with a single click, eliminating the need for manual item selection.
The system streamlines the process by recreating the cart, retrieving shipping information, and pre-filling payment details from past orders.
This feature is exclusively accessible to logged-in users, ensuring a secure and personalized shopping experience.

For more information, see [reorder documentation](TODO add link).

#### Orders block

Orders block displays a list of orders associated with a specific company or an individual customer.
This block allows customization of the number of orders shown, sorting order, and placement on the page.

For more information, see [Orders block documentation](https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/master/content_management/block_reference/#orders-block).

#### Quick order

The quick order form allows users to streamlines the process of placing orders 
with multiple items in bulk directly from the storefront.
Customers don't need to look for products, 
they can fill in a provided form with products' SKU number and quantity, 
or upload their own list directly into the system. 
Quick order form is available to both registered and guest users.

For more information, see [Quick order documentation](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/master/commerce/cart/quick_order/).

#### Shipping management

Shipping management allows you to work with the shipments: view and modify their status, filter shipments in shipment lists and check all the details.
You can access shipments for your own orders or all the shipments that exist in the system, depending on your permissions.

For more information, see [Work with shipments](https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/master/commerce/shipping_management/work_with_shipments/).

#### Owner criterion

Orders and shipments search now supports user reference:

- `OwnerCriterion` Criterion searches for orders based on the user reference.
- `Owner` Criterion searches for shipments based on the user reference.

#### Customize checkout workflow

You can create a PHP definition of the new strategy that allows for workflow manipulation. 
Defining strategy allows to add conditional steps for workflow if needed.
When a conditional step is added, the checkout process uses the specified workflow and proceeds to the defined step.

For more information, see (https://doc.ibexa.co/en/master/commerce/checkout/customize_checkout/#create-custom-strategy)

### New features and improvements in PIM

#### Virtual products

With this feature, you can create virtual products - non-tangible items such as memberships, services, warranties.
To create a virtual product, first, you have to create a virtual Product Type.
Virtual products donâ€™t require shipment when they are purchased without other physical products.

For more information, see [Create virtual products](https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/master/pim/create_virtual_product/.)

#### IsVirtual Criterion

Product search now supports product virutal and physical product type:

- `IsVirtual` - searches for virtual or physical products. 

#### Product page URLs

When you are creating new product type you can set up product URL alias name pattern.
With this feature, you can also create custom URL and URL alias name pattern field based on product attributes.
Customized URLs are easy to remember, help with SEO optimization and reduce bounce rates on the website. 

For more information, see [Product page URLs](https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/master/pim/work_with_product_page_urls/).
