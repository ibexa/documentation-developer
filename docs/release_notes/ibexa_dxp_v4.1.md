# Ibexa DXP v4.1

**Version number**: v4.1

**Release date**: April 15, 2022

**Release type**: [Fast Track](https://support.ibexa.co/Public/service-life)

## Notable changes

### Product catalog enhancements

With this release, product catalog brings new PHP APIs, productivity boost from new product search criteria and sort classes, advanced filtering in REST endpoints, auto-generated identifiers, product list sorting, and more.

You can now use [advanced filtering on products, product types, attributes, and others in REST endpoints](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/4.1/api/rest_api_reference/rest_api_reference.html#product-catalog-filter-currencies).

Currencies, regions and customer groups can now be resolved automatically in the PHP API
based on the current context (for example, selected locale).

A new Color attribute enables adding a product attribute that uses the color picker to select a precise color.

The product catalog is now fully integrated with the transactional system integration, enabling a full purchasing process.
  
### Measurement Field Type and attribute

With the new Measurement Field Type users can now add a Measurement Field, with different pre-built units, to content:

The new Measurement product attribute enables describing products with different types and units of measurement:

### Image optimization

Images modified in the Image Editor are now optimized for reduced file size.
You can use external libraries to [optimize different image formats](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/4.1/guide/images/#image-optimization).

### Expanded data migrations

[Data migration](data_migration.md) now covers additional objects:

- [database settings](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/4.1/guide/data_migration/importing_data/#settings)
- [segments](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/4.1/guide/data_migration/importing_data/#segments)
- [prices](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/4.1/guide/data_migration/importing_data/#prices) with `create` mode
- [settings](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/4.1/guide/data_migration/importing_data/#settings)

Data migration now also offers a locking capability,
which prevents multiple processes from executing the same migration and causing duplicated records.
