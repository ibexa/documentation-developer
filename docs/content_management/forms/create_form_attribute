# Create Form Builder Form attribute 

You can create Form attribute for the new Form fields or existing ones.
Define new Form attribute in configuration.

## Configure Form attribute

For example, to create a "richtext_description" attribute,
provide the following configuration, `config/packages/ezplatform.yaml`:

``` yaml
[[= include_file('code_samples/forms/custom_form_field/config/packages/form_attribute.yaml') =]]
```
You can edit Form attribute in the Form Builder's editor. 
Make sure that the value of the attribute is passed on the the Field once that is rendered.

## Create mapper

New Form attributes require a mapper which implements the `Ibexa\Contracts\FormBuilder\FieldType\Field\FieldMapperInterface` in `config/services.yaml`:

``` php

```

Then, register the mapper as a service:

``` yaml

```

Now you can go to Back Office and build a new form.
You should be able to see the new section in the list of available fields:
