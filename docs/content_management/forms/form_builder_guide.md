### Create a form

Editors can use the created form anywhere on the website. 
Forms can be used in page blocks, embedded in the online editor or even used as a field relation. 
The same form can be placed at multiple locations on the website.

To learn more, see [Work with forms]([[= user_doc =]]/content_management/work_with_forms/).

### Forms management

[Form](forms.md) is one of available [Content items]([[= user_doc =]]/content_management/content_items/) that you can find in the platform. 
You can work with it as with other regular items: create new one, edit existing one, move, etc.

You can manage all the existing forms. To do it, in a selected place of the content tree find your form and click on it.
In this window you can see all the information about your form, view submissions, create versions, etc.

Using the buttons in the right corner, you can also edit, move, copy, hide or send your form to the trash.

### Form API

To manage form submissions created in the Form Builder, use `FormSubmissionServiceInterface`.
You can get existing form submission and create or delete one.
Detailed instruction of getting, creating and deleting form submissions, you can find in Ibexa Developer Documentation in [Form API page](form_api.md).

### Extend Form Builder

You can extend the Form Builder by adding new Form fields or modifying existing ones. 
To create new form fields, you need to [define them in configuration](create_custom_form_field.md). 
Fields or fields attributes [can be modified](create_custom_form_field.md#modify-existing-form-fields) by subscribing `ibexa.form_builder.field.<FIELD_ID>` or `ibexa.form_builder.field.<FIELD_ID>.<ATTRIBUTE_ID>` events.

### Create new Form attribute

Each Form has available attributes, for example, string, text, location, etc.
You can also [create a Form attribute](create_form_attribute.md) for new Form fields or existing ones.

To do it, you have to:

1. define a new Form attribute in the configuration,
1. create a mapper,
1. add Symfony form type,
1. customize Form templates,
1. add scripts,
1. implement Field,
1. implement field mapper,
1. create submission converter.

### View results

You can preview the results of each published form.
To do it, go to **Submissions** tab in the Content item view:

![View results](img/view_results.png)

Here you can view the details of each submission or delete any of them.

The **Download submissions** button enables you to download all the submissions in a .CSV (comma-separated value) file.
