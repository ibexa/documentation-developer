# Ibexa Connect scenario block

[[= product_name_connect =]] scenario block retrieves and displays data from an [[= product_name_connect =]] webhook. 
Scenario block is a regular [Page block](page_blocks.md) and can be configured on field definition level as any other block.

!!! caution
    
    When setting up your instance, ensure you have profiler enabled.
    To set up Page Builder in [[= product_name =]], follow the [Page and Form tutorial](page_and_form_tutorial.md).

## Scenario block configuration

In the following example you can learn how to configure [[= product_name_connect =]] scenario block with two available templates: `company_customers` and `external_clients`.

### Block templates

First, in `config/packages/ibexa_connect.yaml` add the following configuration:

``` yaml
[[= include_file('code_samples/page/ibexa_connect_scenario_block/config/packages/ibexa_connect.yaml') =]]
```

For each block template you can set up additional settings, for example, label, type or parameters. 

### Define page layouts

To preview your block in the frontend, define page layouts in `config/packages/views.yaml` directory. This file defines, which layouts are used to render Page Builder. 

```yaml
[[= include_file('code_samples/page/ibexa_connect_scenario_block/config/packages/views.yaml') =]]
```

You also need to create `pagelayout.html.twig` file in `templates` folder:

```html+twig
[[= include_file('code_samples/page/ibexa_connect_scenario_block/templates/pagelayout.html.twig') =]]
```

Then, in `templates/blocks` directory under `default.html.twig`, provide your block configuration:

```html+twig
[[= include_file('code_samples/page/ibexa_connect_scenario_block/templates/blocks/default.html.twig') =]]
```

In the following example, the configuration of the block is non-complex - block is only used to display the content transferred from an [[= product_name_connect =]] webhook.
At this point the [[= product_name_connect =]] scenario block is ready to be used in Page Builder.

### Configure Ibexa Connect scenario block in Page Builder

Now, you can configure [[= product_name_connect =]] scenario block in Page Builder.
To do it, in your Page add [[= product_name_connect =]] block by dragging it from the menu to a drop zone and enter block settings. 

- In the **Basic** tab in **Webhook link** field, provide a link to an [[= product_name_connect =]] webhook, 
for example, `https://connect.ibexa.co/3/scenarios/688/edit`:

- In the **Design** tab, choose one of declared templates, in the following example, `company_customers` or `External clients`. 
To do it, extend drop-down list in the **View** field and choose one of the available options.

Click **Submit** button to confirm.
After submitting the block, Page refreshes and [[= product_name_connect =]] block displays data from provided [[= product_name_connect =]] webhook.
