### Edit page

Then, from the Content Tree choose the page that you want you edit and click **Edit** button.

## What is Page Builder

Page Builder is a visual tool that allows you to create and edit any page in [[= product_name =]].
It is more than managing: it is about building pages, creating customized content and fully-targeted landing pages.
Creating pages in Page Builder involves composing content using ready-to-use elements - blocks, properly configured and customized.
It is also important to choose a layout - it determines the arrangement of drop zones that contain content elements.

Applying a layout divides the Page into the defined zones. The zones are placeholders for Content items.

On the Page creation modal, select the layout and click **Create draft**.
Now you are ready to add blocks of content to the Page.

The page layouts that an editor has access to are up to you to choose.
In the `Select layouts` section, you can select layouts that you want to be available for the Page.

#### Add blocks

To customize your page in Page Builder you need to add blocks. You can do it in two ways:

A. Access Elements toolbar, drag page block that you want to use and drop it on the empty place on a drop zone.

B. Choose available drop zone and use `Click to select` option.

Ready-to-use blocks available in [[= product_name =]] have their own, unique functions, but you can also [add your own, custom blocks](create_custom_page_block.md). All available tools and settings, that Page Builder comes with, enable you to customize the content appearing on the page.

You can check all ready-to-use blocks available in Page Builder in User Documentation, [Block reference page](https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/latest/content_management/block_reference/).

#### Work with blocks

Page Builder has two main views that you can use while creating a page:

- Elements toolbar - consists of all available elements that you can use by dragging them and dropping on a drop zone.
- Structure view - shows a structure of your page, including their division into zones and the blocks that they contain.

Working with blocks is intuitive. You don't have to worry about placing blocks in the proper place from the start - you can reorder the at any time.
You can reorder blocks in a few ways:

- drag and drop block in the desired location on a drop zone
- select block and use up and down arrow on the keyboard
- access Structure view and use 'Move up' and 'Move down' function in the settings of the block

You can manage each block by accessing its settings. To do it, click settings icon next to the block's name.
Available settings are:

- Move up - allows you to change position of the block on the page by moving it up
- Move down - allows you to change position of the block on the page by moving it down
- Configuration - allows you to access configuration window
- Duplicate - duplicates existing block by creating its copy
