By editing pages you can customize the layout and content of your website.

You can also add a new page in the Page Builder. Check 'Create page in Page Builder' section below.

### Edit page

You can edit any existing page by using Page Builder. To do it, in the Back Office go to **Content** and select **Content structure**.
Then, from the Content Tree choose the page that you want you edit and click **Edit**.

## What is Page Builder

Page Builder is a visual tool that allows you to create and edit any page in [[= product_name =]].
It is more than managing: it is about building pages, creating customized content and fully-targeted landing pages.
Creating pages in Page Builder involves composing content using ready-to-use elements - blocks, properly configured and customized.
It is also important to choose a layout - it determines the arrangement of drop zones that contain content elements.

![Elements toolbar](elements_toolbar.png)

- Structure view - shows a structure of your page, including their division into zones and the blocks that they contain. It follows the behavior of the content tree. Structure view has ability to reorder blocks using drag and drop.

![Structure view](structure_view.png)

#### Create page in Page Builder

To open the Page Builder, click **Site** and select a website from the list that appears next to the List icon.
On the Page Builder toolbar click the plus button and from the list select Landing Page.

##### Choose layout

For newly created Page you can choose a [layout](https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/latest/content_management/configure_ct_field_settings/#available-page-layouts) which defines the available zones.

![Switch layout](switch_layout_window.png)

Applying a layout divides the Page into the defined zones. The zones are placeholders for Content items.

On the Page creation modal, select the layout and click **Create draft**.
Now you are ready to add blocks of content to the Page.

The page layouts that an editor has access to are up to you to choose.
In the `Select layouts` section, you can select layouts that you want to be available for the Page.

The default, built-in Page layout has only one zone, but developers can create other layouts in configuration.
For more information, see [Configure layout](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/templating/render_content/render_page/#configure-layout).

#### Add blocks

To customize your page in Page Builder you need to add blocks. You can do it in two ways:

A. Access Elements toolbar, drag page block that you want to use and drop it on the empty place on a drop zone.

B. Choose available drop zone and use `Click to select` option.

When you add a new block to the drop zone, before you drop it, a blue line appears  - it helps you see the position of the newly added block in relation to other, already added blocks.

![Drop zone line](drop_zone_line.png)

Ready-to-use blocks available in [[= product_name =]] have their own, unique functions, but you can also [add your own, custom blocks](create_custom_page_block.md). All available tools and settings, that Page Builder comes with, enable you to customize the content appearing on the page.

You can check all ready-to-use blocks available in Page Builder in User Documentation, [Block reference page](https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/latest/content_management/block_reference/).

#### Work with blocks

Working with blocks is intuitive. You don't have to worry about placing blocks in the proper place from the start - you can reorder the at any time.
You can reorder blocks in a few ways:

- drag and drop block in the desired location on a drop zone
- select block and use up and down arrow on the keyboard
- access Structure view and use 'Move up' and 'Move down' function in the settings of the block or drag and drop to change the position in the structure

![Structure view - drag and drop](structure_view_drag_drop.png)

You can manage each block by accessing its settings. To do it, click settings icon next to the block's name.

![Block settings](block_settings.png)

Available settings are:

- Move up - allows you to change position of the block on the page by moving it up
- Move down - allows you to change position of the block on the page by moving it down
- Configuration - allows you to access configuration window
- Duplicate - duplicates existing block by creating its copy
- Refresh - refreshes preview of the block
- Delete - deletes existing block

#### Schedule content

Page Builder comes with a Scheduler - is a tool that allows you to schedule content publication.

You can schedule to be published, or hidden in Page Builder in two ways with:

- **Scheduler tab** - it's available in the configuration of all Page blocks. In this tab you can set the date and time when the block becomes visible and when it disappears from a Page.

![Scheduler tab](scheduler_tab.png)

- **Content Scheduler** - it's one of the block available in Page Builder Elements menu. To proceed with the schedule, go to **Basic** tab of the block, then click **Select contennt** and confirm your choice, and set date and time in the Content airtime settings window.
