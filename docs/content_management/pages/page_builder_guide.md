### Edit page

You can edit any existing page by using Page Builder. To do it, in the Back Office go to **Content** and select **Content structure**.
Then, from the Content Tree choose the page and click **Edit**.

## What is Page Builder

Page Builder is a visual tool that allows you to create and edit any page in [[= product_name =]].
It is more than managing: it is about building pages, creating customized content and fully-targeted landing pages.
Creating pages in Page Builder involves composing content using ready-to-use elements - blocks, properly configured and customized.
It is also important to choose a layout - it determines the arrangement of drop zones that contain content elements.

Page Builder has two main views that you can use while creating a page:

- Elements toolbar - consists of all available elements that you can use by dragging them and dropping on a drop zone.

![Elements toolbar](elements_toolbar.png)

- Structure view - shows a structure of the page, including its division into zones and the blocks that it contains. It follows the behavior of the Content Tree. Structure view has ability to reorder blocks using drag and drop.

![Structure view](structure_view.png)

##### Choose layout

For newly created Page you can choose a [layout]([[= user_doc =]]/content_management/configure_ct_field_settings/#available-page-layouts) which defines the available zones.

Applying a layout divides the Page into the defined zones. The zones are placeholders for content items.

On the Page creation modal, select the layout and click **Create draft**.
Now you are ready to add blocks of content to the Page.

The page layouts that an editor has access to are up to you to choose.
In the `Select layouts` section, you can select layouts that you want to be available for the Page.

![Switch layout](switch_layout_window.png)

The default, built-in Page layout has only one zone, but developers can create other layouts in configuration.
For more information, see [Configure layout](render_page.md#configure-layout).

#### Add blocks

To customize your page in Page Builder you need to add blocks.
To do it, access Elements toolbar, drag page block that you want to use, and drop it on the empty place on a drop zone.

When you add a new block to the drop zone, drop it in the blue highlighted area. Before you drop it, a bold line appears  - it helps you see the position of the newly added block in relation to other, already added blocks.

![Drop zone line](drop_zone_line.png)

Ready-to-use blocks available in [[= product_name =]] have their own, unique functions, but you can also [add your own, custom blocks](create_custom_page_block.md). All available tools and settings, that Page Builder comes with, enable you to customize the content appearing on the page.

You can check all ready-to-use blocks available in Page Builder in User Documentation, [Block reference page]([[= user_doc =]]/content_management/block_reference/).

#### Work with blocks

Working with blocks is intuitive. You don't have to worry about placing blocks in the proper place from the start - you can reorder them at any time.
You can reorder blocks in a few ways:

- drag and drop block in the desired location on a drop zone
- select block and use up and down arrow on the keyboard
- access Structure view and use 'Move up' and 'Move down' function in the settings of the block or drag and drop to change the position in the structure

![Structure view - drag and drop](structure_view_drag_drop.png)

You can manage each block by accessing its settings. To do it, click settings icon next to the block's name.

![Block settings](block_settings.png)

Available settings are:

- Move up - allows you to change position of the block on the page by moving it up
- Move down - allows you to change position of the block on the page by moving it down
- Configuration - allows you to access configuration window
- Duplicate - duplicates a block with its settings, by creating a copy of it that appears below the original block
- Refresh - refreshes preview of the block
- Delete - deletes existing block

#### Distraction free mode

While configuring blocks that include Rich Text section, for example, Text block, you can switch to distraction free mode that expands the workspace to full screen.

![Distraction free mode](distraction_free_mode.png)

For more information, see [Distraction free mode]([[= user_doc =]]/content_management/create_edit_content_items/#distraction-free-mode/).

#### Schedule content

Page Builder comes with a Scheduler, it allows you to schedule content appearance.

You can schedule content to be revealed, or hidden in Page Builder in two ways with:

- **Scheduler tab** - it's available in the configuration of all Page blocks. In this tab you can set the date and time when the block becomes visible and when it disappears from a Page.

![Scheduler tab](scheduler_tab.png)

- **Content Scheduler** - it's one of the blocks available in Page Builder Elements menu. To proceed with the schedule, go to **Basic** tab of the block, then click **Select content** and confirm your choice. Then set date and time in the **Content airtime settings** window.

For more information, see [Schedule publication]([[= user_doc =]]/content_management/schedule_publishing/).
