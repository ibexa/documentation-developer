# Collaborative editing product guide

## What is collaborative editing

Collaborative editing enables multiple users to work on the same content simultaneously.
The system automatically tracks changes, allowing seamless collaboration within a single content item.
Users can edit and review content in real time, making teamwork faster, more efficient, and streamlining the content review process.

## Availability

Collaborative editing is available in all [[= product_name =]] editions.

## How does collaborative editing work

Collaborative editing allows to work together on the same content item in real time.
This is done through a collaboration session.

When you create a new draft of a content item, you can start a collaboration session by clicking the **Share** button.
This action generates a unique session for that draft.
You can invite other users to join the session, both internal and external.
Once they accept the invitation, they are able to join you in the editor and make changes in real time.

Everyone in the session can see each other's updates as they happen—no more switching between tools or waiting for feedback.
This makes content creation and review faster, more interactive, and much easier to manage as a team.

## Capabilities

### Editing content item

Real-time collaboration is enabled in rich text fields.
Other fields are disabled and can be only edited by the owner of the content item.

Real-time collaboration is available for the following content types containing rich text fields:

- Article
- Folder
- Form
- Product category
- Custom content types
- Product (without variants)

## How to get started

To start collaborative editing, you need to invite collaborators.
To do it, click the **Share** button, which creates a new collaboration session.
Then, in a pop-up window, you can invite users to newly created session.

## Benefits

### Real-time collaboration

Collaborative editing enables multiple users to work on the same content item at the same time.
Everyone in the session can see changes as they happen, which eliminates the delays in feedback and updates or waiting for someone to finish editing before others can contribute.

### Improved efficiency

By allowing simultaneous editing, the content creation and review process becomes significantly faster.
Team members can work together and finalize content in a fraction of the time it would take with a standard workflow.

### Enhanced teamwork

All the users invitated to the collaboration session can share ideas, make suggestions, and refine each other’s work in a shared environment, fostering a stronger sense of team ownership and collaboration.

### Seamless feedback loop

Users can share and receive feedback instantly within the same editing interface.
This reduces the need to switch between apps or track changes manually.

### Simplified content review process

With real-time access to the same draft, reviewers can jump in, provide input, and approve content more quickly.
This streamlines the entire review cycle and minimizes delays caused by version confusion or slow feedback.

### Cross-functional collaboration

Collaborative editing allows teams to involve users from across the organization.
Their input can be integrated directly into the editing process, leading to more accurate and aligned content.

### Change tracking

All changes made by the editors belonging to the session are automatically tracked, so you can see what was edited, by whom, and when.
This provides full transparency and makes it easy to review.
