# Field type reference

A field type is the underlying building block of the content model.
It consists of two entities: field value and field definition.
Field value is determined by values entered into the content field.
Field definition is provided by the content type, and holds any user defined rules used by field type to determine how a field value is, for example, validated, stored, retrieved, or formatted.

[[= product_name =]] comes with a collection of field types that can be used to build powerful and complex content structures.
In addition, it's possible to extend the system by creating custom types for special needs.

!!! tip

    For general field type documentation, see [field type](field_types.md).

Custom field types have to be programmed in PHP. However, the built-in field types are usually sufficient enough for typical scenarios.
The following table gives an overview of the supported field types that come with [[= product_name =]].

<a id="1-note-on-legacy-search-engine"></a>**^[1]^ Note on Legacy Search Engine**

Legacy Search/Storage Engine index is limited to 255 characters in database design, so formatted and unformatted text blocks only index the first part.
In case of multiple selection field types like, for example, Keyword, Selection, or Country, only the first choices are indexed. they're indexed only as a text blob separated by string separator.
Proper indexing of these field types is done with [Solr Search engine](solr_overview.md).
