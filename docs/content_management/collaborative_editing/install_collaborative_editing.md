# Install Collaborative editing

Collaborative editing feature is available as an LTS update to [[= product_name =]] starting with version v5.0 or higher, regardless of its edition.
To use this feature you must first install the packages and configure them.

## Install packages

Run the following commands to install the packages:

``` bash
composer require ibexa/collaboration
composer require ibexa/share
composer require ibexa/fieldtype-richtext-rte
```

This command adds the new real-time editing functionality to the Rich Text field type.
It also modifies the permission system to account for the new functionality.

## Configure Collaborative editing

Once the packages are installed, before you can start Collaborative editing feature, you must enable it by following these instructions.

To add the tables to the database, run the following command:

``` bash
php bin/console ibexa:doctrine:schema:dump-sql vendor/ibexa/collaboration/src/bundle/Resources/config/schema.yaml | mysql -u <username> -p <password> <database_name>
php bin/console ibexa:doctrine:schema:dump-sql vendor/ibexa/share/src/bundle/Resources/config/schema.yaml | mysql -u <username> -p <password> <database_name>
```

### Modify the bundles file

Then, in the `config/bundles.php` file, add the following code:

``` php
    <?php

return [
    // A lot of bundlesâ€¦
    Ibexa\Bundle\Collaboration\IbexaCollaborationBundle::class => ['all' => true],
    Ibexa\Bundle\Share\IbexaShareBundle::class => ['all' => true],
    Ibexa\Bundle\FieldTypeRichTextRTE\IbexaFieldTypeRichTextRTEBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];
```
