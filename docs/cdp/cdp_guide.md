### Installation and configuration

To start using [[= product_name_cdp =]], first you need to contact your sales representative, who provides you with a link to [register your [[= product_name_cdp =]] account](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/cdp/cdp_installation/#register-in-ibexa-cdp-dashboard). When you're done with registration process, you'll be able to access a separate instance with the data needed to configure, activate, and use this feature.

After your account is created, you can [download and install the [[= product_name_cdp =]] package](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/cdp/cdp_installation/#install-cdp-package) that is opt-in and needs to be downloaded separately. Last step is to go through the [configuration process](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/cdp/cdp_activation/cdp_configuration/).

### Segment groups

To create a personalized customer experience, you need to group your clients into specified audiences.
[[= product_name =]] comes with a ready solution - segment groups.
Segment group information is reused by various [[= product_name =]] functionalities, such as [Personalization](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/personalization/personalization_brochure/) or content targeting.

You can [create a segment group](https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/latest/personalization/segment_management/) in the Back Office of [[= product_name =]]. It serves as a container for all segments data generated by [[= product_name_cdp =]].
When you create a segment group, you need to provide its name and identifier.
Be careful while doing so, as after you create the segment group in the Back Office and connect it to [[= product_name_cdp =]], you cannot change it in any way, including edit its name.

Remember to add a segment group identifier to the configuration, under the `segment_group_identifier` field.

## Capabilities

### Data export

Configuration in [[= product_name_cdp =]] allows you to automate the process of exporting Content, Users, and Products.
An `ibexa_cdp.data_export` [configuration key](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/cdp/cdp_data_export_schedule/#configuration-key) includes the `schedule` setting where you can find separate sections for exporting User, Content, and Product. Structure of each section is exactly the same and includes `interval` and `options` elements:

- `interval` - sets the frequency of the command invoke using cron expressions, for example, '*/30 * * * *' means "every 30 minutes", '0 */12 * * *' means "every 12th hour".

- `options` - allows you to add arguments that have to be passed to the export command.

This configuration allows you to provide multiple export workflows with parameters. It's important, because all the types of content/product must have their own parameters on the CDP side, where each has a different Stream ID key and different required values configured per data source.

Regarding data export, currently, only Stream File transport is supported and can be initialized from the configuration.

For more information, see [CDP data export](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/cdp/cdp_activation/cdp_data_export/).

### Data customization

​You can customize Content and Product data exported to [[= product_name_cdp =]] and control what Field Type information you want to export.
With [[= product_name_cdp =]], you can export Field Types and Field Type values. They are exported with metadata and attributes, for example, ID, Field Definition name, type, value.

For more information, see [data customization](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/cdp/cdp_data_customization/#data-customization) documentation in Developer Documentation.

### Client-side Tracking

The final step is setting up a tracking script.
For more information, see [CDP add client-side tracking](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/cdp/cdp_activation/cdp_add_clientside_tracking/) and [tutorial in Raptor documentation](https://support.raptorsmartadvisor.com/hc/en-us/articles/9563346335004-Client-Side-Tracking).

### Audience Builder

In the Audience Builder, you can create audiences - groups of users that meet the assumed conditions.
You can choose specific conditions: `did`, `did not`, or `have`.
The conditions `did` and `did not` allow you to use events like buy, visit or add to a cart from online tracking. The  `have` conditions are tied to personal characteristics and can be used to track the sum of all buys or top-visited categories.

You can also connect created audiences to the activations.
