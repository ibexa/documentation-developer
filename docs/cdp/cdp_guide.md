To start using [[= product_name_cdp =]], first you need to contact your sales representative. You'll receive a link to [register your [[= product_name_cdp =]] account](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/cdp/cdp_installation/#install-cdp-package). Once you'll be done with registration process, you'll be able to access a separate instance with the data needed to configure, activate, and use this feature. 

Once your account is created, you can [download and install [[= product_name_cdp =]] package](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/cdp/cdp_installation/#install-cdp-package) that is opt-in and needs to be downloaded separately.

### Segment groups

To create a personalized customer experience, you need to group your clients into specified audiences.
[[= product_name =]] comes with a ready solution - segment groups.
Segments make it possible to receive customized content for specific user groups. They use the segments attribute factor to compute models. Data from the tracking script is used to deliver user segment information in every event. You can provide recommendations to distinct user groups by using segment groups and assign users to the groups according to the data collected.

You can [create a segment group](https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/latest/personalization/segment_management/) in the Back Office of [[= product_name =]]. It serves as a container for all segments data generated by [[= product_name_cdp =]].
While creating a segment group, you need to provide name and identifier. Choose wisely, as after you create the segment group in the Back Office and connect it to [[= product_name_cdp =]], you cannot change it in any way, including edit its name.

Each segment group needs to be added in the [configuration key](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/cdp/cdp_activation/cdp_configuration/), under `segment_group_identifier` field.

## Capabilities

### Data export

Configuration in [[= product_name_cdp =]] allows you to automate the process of exporting Content, Users, and Products.
Under the schedule setting you can find separate sections for exporting User, Content, and Product. Structure of each section is exactly the same and includes interval and options elements:

- Interval - sets the frequency of the command invoke, for example, '*/30 * * * *' means "every 30 minutes", '0 */12 * * *' means "every 12 hours".

- Options - allows you to add arguments that have to be passed to the export command.

This configuration allows you to provide multiple export workflows with parameters. It's important, because each type of content/product must have its own parameters on the CDP side, where each has a different Stream ID key and different required values, which are configured per data source.

To check all the process of data export, see [data export](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/cdp/cdp_activation/cdp_data_export/).

### Data customization

​You can customize Content and Product data exported to [[= product_name_cdp =]] and you can control what Field Type information you want to export.
With [[= product_name_cdp =]] you can export Field Types and Field Type values. They are exported with metadata, for example, ID, Field Definition name, type, value.

For more information, see [data customization](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/cdp/cdp_data_customization/#data-customization) documentation in Developer Documentation.

### Client-side Tracking

The final step is setting up a tracking script.
It requires a head tracking script on your website, a main script after the head script, and cookie consent.
For more information about setting up a tracking script, see [a tutorial in Raptor documentation](https://support.raptorsmartadvisor.com/hc/en-us/articles/9563346335004-Client-Side-Tracking).

### Audience Builder

In the Audience Builder, you can create audiendes - groups of users that meet the assumed conditions. You can choose specific conditions: `did`, `did not`, or `have`.
The conditions `did` and `did not` allow you to use events like buy, visit or add to a cart from online tracking. The  `have` conditions are tied to personal characteristics and can be used to track the sum of all buys or top-visited categories. 

You can also connect created audiences to the activations.
