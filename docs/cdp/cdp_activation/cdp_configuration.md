# Configuration

To configure [[= product_name_cdp =]], use the `ibexa.system.<scope>.cdp` [configuration key](configuration.md#configuration-files):

```yaml
ibexa:
    system:
        default:
            cdp:
                account_number: 123456
                data_export:
                    user_data:
                        transport: stream_file
                        stream_file:
                            stream_id: 00000000-00000000-00000000-00000000
                activations:
                    -
                        client_id: '%env(CDP_ACTIVATION_CLIENT_ID)%'
                        client_secret: '%env(CDP_ACTIVATION_CLIENT_SECRET)%'
                        segment_group_identifier: example_segment_group_identifier
```

All configuration settings are described below.
You can follow them step by step to set up your [[= product_name_cdp =]].

## Segment group

First, create a segment group in the Back Office.
It will serve as a container for all segments data generated by [[= product_name_cdp =]].
Go to **Admin** -> **Segments** and select **Create**.
Fill in name and identifier for a segment group.
Choose wisely, as once connected to CDP Segment Group cannot be changed.

Next, add a segment group identifier to the configuration.

!!! caution "[[= product_name_cdp =]] Segment Group"

    After you create the Segment Group in the Back Office and connect it to [[= product_name_cdp =]], you cannot change it in any way, including edit its name.

## Account number

Now, fill in the account number.
Log in to [[= product_name_cdp =]] and in the top right corner, select available accounts.
