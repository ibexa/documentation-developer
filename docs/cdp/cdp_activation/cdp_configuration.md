# Configuration

To configure [[= product_name_cdp =]], use the `ibexa.system.<scope>.cdp` [configuration key](configuration.md#configuration-files):

```yaml
ibexa:
    system:
        default:
            cdp:
                account_number: 123456
                data_export:
                    user_data:
                        transport: stream_file
                        stream_file:
                            stream_id: 00000000-00000000-00000000-00000000
                    content_data:
                        transport: stream_file
                        stream_file:
                            stream_id: 00000000-00000000-00000000-00000000
                    product_data:
                        transport: stream_file
                        stream_file:
                            stream_id: 00000000-00000000-00000000-00000000
                activations:
                        client_id: '%env(CDP_ACTIVATION_CLIENT_ID)%'
                        client_secret: '%env(CDP_ACTIVATION_CLIENT_SECRET)%'
                        segment_group_identifier: ibexa_cdp
```

- `account_number` - a [number](#account-number) obtained from Accounts settings in [[= product_name_cdp =]] dashboard
- `stream_id` - stream ID generated when importing data from the stream file in Data Manage
- `activations` - activation details. You can configure multiple activations. They have to be of type `Ibexa` in [[= product_name =]] dashboard
- `client_id` and `client_secret` - client credentials are used to authenticate against the Webhook endpoint. Make sure they are random and secure
- `segment_group_identifier` - a [location](#segment-group) to which CDP data is imported

## Account number

Now, fill in the account number.
Log in to [[= product_name_cdp =]] and in the top right corner, select available accounts.

A pop-up window displays a list of all available accounts and their numbers.

## Segment group

Create a segment group in the Back Office.
It serves as a container for all segments data generated by [[= product_name_cdp =]].
Go to **Admin** -> **Segments** and select **Create**.
Fill in name and identifier for a segment group.
Choose wisely, as once connected to CDP Segment Group cannot be changed.

!!! caution "[[= product_name_cdp =]] Segment Group"

    After you create the Segment Group in the Back Office and connect it to [[= product_name_cdp =]], you cannot change it in any way, including edit its name.

Next, add a segment group identifier to the configuration.
