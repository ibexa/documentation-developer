At this point, you should have a `composer.json` file with the correct requirements and you can update dependencies.

If you want to first test how the update proceeds without actually updating any packages, you can try the command with the `--dry-run` switch:

``` bash
composer update --dry-run
```

Then, run `composer update` to update the dependencies. 

``` bash
composer update
```
