At this point, you should have a `composer.json` file with the correct requirements. Run `composer update` to update the dependencies. 

``` bash
composer update
```

If you want to first test how the update proceeds without actually updating any packages, you can try the command with the `--dry-run` switch:

``` bash
composer update --dry-run
```
