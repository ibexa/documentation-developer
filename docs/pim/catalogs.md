# Catalogs

You can create multiple catalogs containing subsets of the whole product list.

Use them, for example, to build special catalogs for B2B and B2C uses, for retailers and distributors or for different regions.

When creating a catalog, all products are included by default, but you can filter the list by:

- price (Solr or Elasticsearch only)
- product attributes
- product type
- product code
- availability
- product category
- the date when the product was created
