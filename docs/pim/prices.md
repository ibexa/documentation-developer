# Prices

The price engine is responsible for calculating prices for products in the [catalog](pim.md).

## Custom pricing

You can set up different prices depending on [customer groups](customer_groups.md).

Each customer group can have a default price discount that applies to all products.

You can also set different prices for specific products or product variants for different customer groups.

## Currency

[[= product_name =]] ships with a list of available currencies, and you can also add custom currencies.
To use currencies in your shop, you need to first enable them in the Back Office.

## VAT

You can [configure VAT rate globally](pim_configuration.md#vat-rates) (per SiteAccess),
or set it individually for each product type and product.
