# Create custom product code generator strategy

Product code generator strategies control what product variant codes are generated.

Besides the [built-in](pim_configuration.md#code-generation-strategy) strategies, you can create your own ones.

A code generator strategy must implement `Ibexa\Contracts\ProductCatalog\Local\CodeGenerator\CodeGeneratorInterface`.

The following example shows how to add a generator strategy that creates code, based on the product base code and an incremental index number.

First, create the generator strategy class:

``` php
[[= include_file('code_samples/catalog/custom_code_generator_strategy/src/CodeGenerator/Strategy/CustomIncrementalCodeGenerator.php') =]]
```

This generator uses the provided context to get product information (in this case the code of the base product)
and the incremental number.

Then, register the strategy generator as a service and tag it with `ibexa.product_catalog.code_generator`:

``` yaml
[[= include_file('code_samples/catalog/custom_code_generator_strategy/config/custom_services.yaml') =]]
```

Use the defined `type` in [catalog configuration](pim_configuration.md#code-generation-strategy)
to apply codes generated by this strategy to new product variants.
