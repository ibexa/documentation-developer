# MatchNone Criterion

The [`MatchNone` Search Criterion](/api/php_api/php_api_reference/classes/Ibexa-Contracts-Core-Repository-Values-Content-Query-Criterion-MatchNone.html) is an auxiliary Criterion that returns no search results.
It's used internally when no filter or query is provided on a Query object.

The Criterion takes no arguments.
