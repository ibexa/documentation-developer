# Order Sort Clauses

Order Sort Clauses are part of [Sort Clauses](sort_clause_reference.md) and they are supported only by Order Search.

By using Sort Clauses you can filter orders by specific attributes, for example: creation date, status, etc.

| Sort Clause | Sorting based on |
|-----|-----|
|[Id](order_id_sort_clause.md)|Order ID|
|[Created](order_created_sort_clause.md)|Date and time when order was created|
|[Updated](order_updated_sort_clause.md)|Date and time when order status was updated|
|[Status](order_status_sort_clause.md)|Order status|
