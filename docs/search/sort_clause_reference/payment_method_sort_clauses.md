# Payment Method Sort Clauses

Payment Method Sort Clauses are part of [Sort Clauses](sort_clause_reference.md) and they are supported only by Payment Method Search.

By using Sort Clauses you can filter payment methods by specific attributes, for example: creation date, ID, and so on.

| Sort Clause | Sorting based on |
|-----|-----|
|[CreatedAt](payment_method_createdat_sort_clause.md)|Date and time when payment method was created|
|[Enabled](payment_method_enabled_sort_clause.md)|Payment method status|
|[Id](payment_method_id_sort_clause.md)|Payment method ID|
|[Identifier](payment_method_identifier_sort_clause.md)|Payment method identifier|
|[UpdatedAt](payment_method_updatedat_sort_clause.md)|Date and time when payment method status was updated|
