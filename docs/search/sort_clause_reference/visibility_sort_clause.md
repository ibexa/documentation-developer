# Visibility Sort Clause

The [`Location\Visibility` Sort Clause](../../api/php_api/php_api_reference/classes/Ibexa-Contracts-Core-Repository-Values-Content-Query-SortClause-Location-Visibility.html) sorts search results by whether the location is visible or not.

Locations that aren't visible are ranked as higher values (for example, with ascending order they're returned last).

## Arguments

[[= include_file('docs/snippets/sort_direction.md') =]]

## Example

``` php
$query = new LocationQuery();
$query->sortClauses = [new SortClause\Location\Visibility()];
```
