# Elasticsearch search engine

Elasticsearch is an open-source, distributed, Java-based search engine that responds to queries
in real-time and is easily scalable in reaction to changing processing needs.

Elasticsearch enables you to use filtering, query, query-time boosting, fulltext search and aggregations. 
It organizes data into documents, that then are grouped into indices.

As a result of having distributed architecture, Elasticsearch can analyze massive amounts of data with almost real-time performance.
Instead of searching text directly, it searches and index. Thanks to this mechanism, it is able to achieve fast response.

For a detailed description of advanced settings that you might require in a specific production environment, 
see the documentation provided by Elastic.
Start with the [Set up Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/setup.html) section.

**Prerequisite**

To proceed you need to be familiar with how indexing, filtering and queries work.
