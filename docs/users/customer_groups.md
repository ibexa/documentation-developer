# Customer groups

You can assign users to different custom groups to enable [custom pricing](../pricing/price_engine.md).
This enables you to give specific prices or price discounts (global or per product) to specific groups of users.

For example, you can offer a 10% discount for all products in the catalog to users who belong to the Resellers customer group.

!!! tip

    Note that customer groups are not the same as [User Groups](user_management.md#user-groups).
    User Groups concern all users in the system and can be used, for example, to handle permissions.
    Customer groups refer specifically to the commerce functionalities and enable handling prices.

## Enabling customer groups

To enable using customer groups, you need to modify the User Content Type's definition
by adding a [Customer Group Field](../../api/field_types_reference/customergroupfield.md).

With this Field you can add a user to any of the predefined customer groups.
