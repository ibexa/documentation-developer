# 2. Merge composer.json

## Manual merging

!!! note "Sorted packages since 2.4 changes"

    Because the 2.4 packages in `composer.json` are sorted, there will be more conflicts when updating to 2.4, but far fewer conflicts in the future. This is controlled by [sort-packages](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#sort-packages) config in `composer.json`.

Conflicts in `composer.json` need to be fixed manually. If you're not familiar with the diff output, you may checkout the tag's version and inspect the changes. It should be readable for most:

**From your new update branch**

``` bash
git checkout --theirs composer.json && git diff HEAD composer.json
```

You should see what was changed, as compared to your own version, in the diff output. The update changes the requirements for all of the `ezsystems/` packages. Those changes should be left untouched. All of the other changes will be removals of what you added for your own project. Use `git checkout -p` to selectively cancel those changes:

``` bash
git checkout -p composer.json
```

Answer `no` (do not discard) to the requirement changes of `ezsystems` dependencies. Answer `yes` (discard) to removals of your changes.

Once you are done, inspect the file, by either using an editor or running `git diff composer.json`. You may also test the file's sanity with `composer validate`, and test the dependencies by running `composer update --dry-run` (it will output what it would do to the dependencies, without applying the changes).

Once finished, run `git add composer.json` and commit.

## Fixing other conflicts

Depending on the local changes you have done, you may get other conflicts on configuration files, kernel, etc.

There shouldn't be many, and you should be able to figure out which value is the right one for all of them:

-   Edit the file, and identify the conflicting changes. If a setting you have modified has also been changed by us, you should be able to figure out which value is the right one.
-   Run `git add conflicting-file` to add the changes
