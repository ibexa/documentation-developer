!!! caution

    Using the MD5-based deprecated hash types is a security risk, because if the hashes are leaked, they are too easily broken by brute-force attacks.
    The plaintext type offers no security. It was only ever intended for testing, and should never be used now.

    We strongly recommend switching to one of the new hash types. If you do, it will be used for new users.
    Existing users will also have their hashes updated to the new type when they log in.
    (A mass update of all hashes is not possible, because this requires knowing the passwords, which only the users themselves do.)
