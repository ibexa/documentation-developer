# BinaryFile Field Type

This Field Type represents and handles a single binary file. It also counts the number of times the file has been downloaded from the `content/download` module.

It is capable of handling virtually any file type and is typically used for storing legacy document types such as PDF files, Word documents, spreadsheets, etc. The maximum allowed file size is determined by the "Max file size" class attribute edit parameter and the `upload_max_filesize` directive in the main PHP configuration file (`php.ini`).

| Name         | Internal name  | Expected input | Output  |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| `BinaryFile` | `ezbinaryfile` | mixed        | mixed |

## PHP API Field Type

### Value Object

#### Properties

Note that both `BinaryFile` and `Media` Value and Type inherit from the `BinaryBase` abstract Field Type, and share common properties.

`eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\BinaryFile\Value` offers the following properties:

|Attribute|Type|Description|Example|
|------|------|------|------|
|`id`|string|Binary file identifier. This ID depends on the [IO Handler](clustering.md#dfs-io-handler) that is being used. With the native, default handlers (FileSystem and Legacy), the ID is the file path, relative to the binary file storage root dir (`var/<vardir>/storage/original` by default).|application/63cd472dd7.pdf|
|`fileName`|string|The human-readable file name, as exposed to the outside. Used when sending the file for download in order to name the file.|20130116_whitepaper.pdf|
|`fileSize`|int|File size, in bytes.|1077923|
|`mimeType`|string|The file's MIME type.|application/pdf|
|`uri`|string|The binary file's `content/download` URI. If the URI doesn't include a host or protocol, it applies to the request domain.|/content/download/210/2707|
|`downloadCount`|integer|Number of times the file was downloaded|0|
|`inputUri`|string|Path to a local file when creating a field value, `null` when reading a field value|`path/to/document.pdf`|

#### Constructor's hash format

The hash format mostly matches the value object. It has the following keys:

| Key             | Status     | Type    | Description                                                                              |
|-----------------|------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `inputUri`      | mandatory  | string  | Path to the local file to be uploaded into the field.                                    |
| `id`            | deprecated | string  | Backward compatibility alias for `inputUri`.                                             |
| `path`          | deprecated | string  | Backward compatibility alias for `inputUri`.                                             |
| `fileName`      | optional   | string  | Name of the file when downloaded. If not given, the basename of `inputUri` is used       |
| `fileSize`      | optional   | integer | Size of the file in bytes. If not given, the size of the `inputUri` target file is used. |
| `downloadCount` | optional   | integer | Number of times the file was downloaded. If not given, set to `0` (zero).                |
| `mimeType`      | ignored    |         |                                                                                          |
| `uri`           | ignored    |         |                                                                                          |

Example:

```php
$fileContentCreateStruct->setField('file', new eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\BinaryFile\Value([
    'fileName' => 'example.pdf',
    'inputUri' => '/tmp/example_for_website.pdf',
]));
```

The original local file name `example_for_website.pdf` is forgotten.
When downloaded, the filename is `example.pdf`.

To use a remote file, you have to download it locally first, then remove it after it's used in `ContentService::createContent`.

## REST API specifics

Used in the REST API, a BinaryFile Field will mostly serialize the hash described above. However there are a couple specifics worth mentioning.

### Reading content: `url` property

When reading the contents of a Field of this type, an extra key is added: `url`. This key gives you the absolute file URL, protocol and host included.

Example:Â `http://example.com/var/ezdemo_site/storage/original/application/63cd472dd7819da7b75e8e2fee507c68.pdf`

### Creating content: `data` property

When creating BinaryFile content with the REST API, it's possible to provide data as a base64 encoded string, by using the `data` fieldValue key:

``` xml
<field>
    <fieldDefinitionIdentifier>file</fieldDefinitionIdentifier>
    <languageCode>eng-GB</languageCode>
    <fieldValue>
        <value key="fileName">My file.pdf</value>
        <value key="fileSize">17589</value>
        <value key="data"><![CDATA[/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAZABkAAD/2wBDAAIBAQIBAQICAgICAgICAwUDAwMDAwYEBAMFBwYHBwcG
...
...]]></value>
    </fieldValue>
</field>
```
