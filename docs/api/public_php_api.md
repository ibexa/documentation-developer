# eZ Platform Public PHP API

The PHP API is also commonly referred to as the "*Public API*". Currently it exposes a Repository which allows you to create, read, update, manage and delete all objects available in eZ Platform, first and foremost content, but also related objects like Sections, Locations, Content Types, Content Type groups, languages and so on.

### eZ Platform API Repository

This entity is the entry point to everything you will do with the Public API.

It will allow you to create, retrieve, update and delete all the eZ Platform objects, as well as Content Types, Sections, Content states. It is always obtained through the service container.

**Obtaining the eZ Platform Repository via the service container**

``` php
/** @var $repository \eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Repository
$repository = $container->get( 'ezpublish.api.repository' );
```

By itself, the repository doesn't do much. It allows three types of operations: user authentication (getting / changing the current user), issuing transactions, and obtaining services. 

!!! tip "Inline objects documentation"

    Pay attention to the inline phpdoc block in this code stub. It tells your IDE that `$repository` is an instance of  `\eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Repository`. If your IDE supports this feature, you will get code completion on the `$repository` object. This helper is a huge time saver when it comes to learning about the eZ Platform API.

### The service container

The above code snippet implies that the [service container](http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/book/service_container.html) is available in the context you are writing your code in.

In controllers, this generally is done by extending the Symfony `Controller` class. It comes with a `get()` method that calls the service container. In command line scripts, it requires that you extend the [`ContainerAwareCommand`](http://api.symfony.com/2.1/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Command/ContainerAwareCommand.html) base class instead of `Controller`. This class provides you with a `getContainer()` method that returns the service container.

!!! note "Getting the repository from eZ Platform controllers"

    In order to make it even easier to obtain the repository from controllers code, eZ Platform controllers extend a custom  [Controller](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Bundle/EzPublishCoreBundle/Controller.html) class that provides a [`getRepository()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Bundle/EzPublishCoreBundle/Controller.html#method_getRepository) method which directly returns the repository from the service container.

    You can and should of course do the same in your custom controllers.

### Authentication

One of the responsibilities of the Repository is user authentication. Every action will be executed *as* a user. In the context of a normal eZ Platform execution, the logged in user will of course be the current one, identified via one of the available authentication methods. This user's permissions will affect the behavior of the Repository. The user may for example not be allowed to create Content, or view a particular Section.

Logging in to the Repository is covered in other recipes of the Cookbook.

### Services

The main entry point to the repository's features are services. The Public API breaks down access to Content, User, Content Types and other features into various services. Those services are obtained via the [Repository](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Repository.html), using `get`\[ServiceName\]`()` methods: `getContentService()`, `getUserService()`, etc.

Throughout the Cookbook, you will be guided through the various capabilities those services have, and how you can use them to implement your projects.

### Value objects

While Services provide interaction with the repository, the elements (Content, Users) they provide interaction with are provided as read-only [Value Objects](http://apidoc.ez.no/doxygen/trunk/NS/html/namespaceeZ_1_1Publish_1_1Core_1_1Repository_1_1Values.html) in the `eZ\Publish\Core\Repository\Values` namespace. Those objects are broken down into sub-namespaces: `Content`, `ContentType`, `User` and `ObjectState`, each sub-namespace containing a set of value objects, such as [`Content\Content`](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezp-next/blob/master/eZ/Publish/Core/Repository/Values/Content/Content.php) or [`User\Role`](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezp-next/blob/master/eZ/Publish/Core/Repository/Values/User/Role.php).

These objects are read-only by design. They are only meant to be used in order to fetch data from the repository. They come with their own properties, such as `$content->id`, `$location->hidden`, but also with methods that provide access to more related information, such as `Relation::getSourceContentInfo()` or `Role::getPolicies()`. By design, a value object will only give you access to data that is very closely related to it. More complex retrieval operations will require you to use the appropriate Service, using information from your Value Object.

#### Value info objects

Some complex Value Objects have an `Info` counterpart, like `ContentInfo`, the counterpart for `Content`. These objects are specific and provide you with lower-level information. For instance, `ContentInfo` will provide you with `currentVersionNo` or `remoteId`, while `Content` will let you retrieve Fields, the Content Type, or previous Versions.

They are provided by the API, but are **read only**, can't be modified and sent back. Creation and modification of Repository values is done using Create structs and Update structs.

### Create and update structs

In order to update or create elements in the Repository, you will use structs. They are usually provided by the Service that manages the Value Objects you want to alter or create. For instance, the Content service has a `getContentCreateStruct()` method that returns a new `ContentCreateStruct` object. Equivalent methods exist for UpdateStruct objects as well, and for most Value Objects.

Using them is also covered in the Cookbook.

## Public API Guide

The public API will give you an easy access to the eZ Platform content repository. This repository is the core component that manages content, Locations, Sections, Content Types, Users, User groups, and Roles. It also provides a new, clear interface for plugging in custom Field Types.

The public API is built on top of a layered architecture, including a persistence API that abstracts storage. By using the public API, you are sure that your code will be forward compatible with future releases based on enhanced, scalable and high-performance storage engines. Applications based on the public API are also fully backwards compatible by using the included storage engine based on the current kernel and database model.

### About this Guide

The objective of this Public API Guide is to progressively lead you through useful, everyday business logic, using the API in concrete recipes: obtaining a Location from a Content item, fetching a set of Content items, creating a User, and so on.

For each recipe, newly introduced elements will be explained in detail, including the required API components (services, value objects, etc.).

#### Suggested tools

In addition to this cookbook, we strongly recommend that you use a full featured PHP IDE, such as Eclipse or PHPStorm. It will provide you information on every piece of code you use, including objects and classes documentation. We have paid very careful attention to PHPDoc throughout this API, and such a tool is a very valuable help when using this API.

On top of this, generated public API documentation can be found online, in various formats:

-   doxygen: <http://apidoc.ez.no/doxygen/trunk/NS/html/>
-   sami: <http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/>

## Getting started with the Public API

In this chapter, we will see two ways of customizing eZ Platform: command line scripts (for import scripts, for instance), and custom controllers.

### Symfony bundle

In order to test and use Public API code, you will need to build a custom bundle. Bundles are Symfony's extensions, and are therefore also used to extend eZ Platform. Symfony 2 provides code generation tools that will let you create your own bundle and get started in a few minutes.

In this chapter, we will show how to create a custom bundle, and implement both a command line script and a custom route with its own controller action and view. All shell commands assume that you use some Linux shell, but those commands would of course also work on Windows systems.

#### Generating a new bundle

First, change the directory to your eZ Platform root.

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/ezplatform
```

Then use the app/console application with the `generate:bundle` command to start the bundle generation wizard.

Let's follow the instructions provided by the wizard. Our objective is to create a bundle named `EzSystems/Bundles/CookBookBundle`, located in the `src` directory.

``` bash
$ php app/console generate:bundle
```

The wizard will first ask about our bundle's namespace. Each bundle's namespace should feature a vendor name (in our own case: `EzSystems`), optionally followed by a sub-namespace (we could have chosen to use `Bundle`), and end with the actual bundle's name, suffixed with Bundle: `CookbookBundle`.

**Bundle namespace**

```
Your application code must be written in bundles. This command helps you generate them easily.

Each bundle is hosted under a namespace (like Acme/Bundle/BlogBundle).

The namespace should begin with a "vendor" name like your company name, your project name, or your client name, followed by one or more optional category sub-namespaces, and it should end with the bundle name itself (which must have Bundle as a suffix).

See http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/bundles/best_practices.html#index-1 for more details on bundle naming conventions.

Use / instead of \ for the namespace delimiter to avoid any problem.

Bundle namespace: EzSystems/CookbookBundle
```

You will then be asked about the Bundle's name, used to reference your bundle in your code. We can go with the default, `EzSystemsCookbookBundle`. Just hit Enter to accept the default.

**Bundle name**

```
In your code, a bundle is often referenced by its name. It can be the concatenation of all namespace parts but it's really up to you to come up with a unique name (a good practice is to start with the vendor name).

Based on the namespace, we suggest EzSystemsCookbookBundle.

Bundle name [EzSystemsCookbookBundle]:
```

The next question is your bundle's location. By default, the script offers to place it in the `src` folder. This is perfectly acceptable unless you have a good reason to place it somewhere else. Just hit Enter to accept the default.

**Bundle directory**

```
The bundle can be generated anywhere. The suggested default directory uses the standard conventions.


Target directory [/path/to/ezpublish5/src]:
```

Next, you need to choose the generated configuration's format, out of YAML, XML, PHP or annotations. We mostly use yaml in eZ Platform, and we will use it in this cookbook. Enter 'yml', and hit Enter.

**Configuration format**

```
Determine the format to use for the generated configuration.                                                                                                                        

Configuration format (yml, xml, php, or annotation) [annotation]: yml
```

The last choice is to generate code snippets demonstrating the Symfony directory structure. If you're learning Symfony, it is a good idea to accept, as it will create a controller, yaml files, etc.

**Generate snippets & directory structure**

```
To help you get started faster, the command can generate some code snippets for you.

Do you want to generate the whole directory structure [no]? yes
```

The generator will then summarize the previous choices, and ask for confirmation. Hit Enter to confirm.

**Summary and confirmation**

```
You are going to generate a "EzSystems\Bundle\CookbookBundle\EzSystemsCookbookBundle" bundle in "/path/to/ezpublish5/src/" using the "yml" format.

Do you confirm generation [yes]? yes
```

The wizard will generate the bundle, check autoloading, and ask about the activation of your bundle. Hit Enter in the answer to both questions to have your bundle automatically added to your Kernel (`app/AppKernel.php`) and routes from your bundle added to the existing routes (`app/config/routing.yml`).

**Activation and generation**

```
  Bundle generation

Generating the bundle code: OK
Checking that the bundle is autoloaded: OK
Confirm automatic update of your Kernel [yes]?
Enabling the bundle inside the Kernel: OK
Confirm automatic update of the Routing [yes]?
Importing the bundle routing resource: OK

  You can now start using the generated code!
 
```

Your bundle should be generated and activated. Let's now see how you can interact with the Public API by creating a command line script, and a custom controller route and action.

#### Creating a command line script in your bundle

Writing a command line script with Symfony 2 is *very* easy. The framework and its bundles ship with a few scripts. They are all started using `php app/console <command>`. You can get the complete list of existing command line scripts by executing `php app/console list` from the eZ Platform root.

In this chapter, we will create a new command, identified as `ezpublish:cookbook:hello`, that takes an optional name argument, and greets that name. To do so, we need one thing: a class with a name ending with "Command" that extends `Symfony\Component\Console\Command\Command`. Note that in our case, we use `ContainerAwareCommand` instead of `Command`, since we need the dependency injection container to interact with the Public API. In your bundle's directory (`src/EzSystems/CookbookBundle`), create a new directory named `Command`, and in this directory, a new file named `HelloCommand.php`.

Add this code to the file:

**HelloCommand.php**

``` php
<?php
namespace EzSystems\CookBookBundle\Command;

use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputArgument;

class HelloCommand extends \Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Command\ContainerAwareCommand
{
    /**
     * Configures the command
     */
    protected function configure()
    {
    }

    /**
     * Executes the command
     * @param InputInterface $input
     * @param OutputInterface $output
     */
    protected function execute( InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output )
    {
    }
}
```

This is the skeleton for a command line script.

One class with a name ending with "Command" (`HelloCommand`), extends `Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Command\Command`, and is part of our bundle's Command namespace. It has two methods: `configure()`, and `execute()`. We also import several classes & interfaces with the use keyword. The first two, `InputInterface` and `OutputInterface` are used to 'typehint' the objects that will allow us to provide input & output management in our script.

`Configure` will be used to set your command's name, as well as its options and arguments. `Execute` will contain the actual implementation of your command. Let's start by creating the `configure()` method.

**TestCommand::configure()**

``` php
protected function configure()
{
    $this->setName( 'ezpublish:cookbook:hello' );
    $this->setDefinition(
        array(
            new InputArgument( 'name', InputArgument::OPTIONAL, 'An argument' )
        )
    );
}
```

First, we use `setName()` to set our command's name to "`ezpublish:cookbook:hello`". We then use `setDefinition()` to add an argument, named `name`, to our command.

You can read more about argument definitions and further options in the [Symfony 2 Console documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/components/console/introduction.html). Once this is done, if you run `php app/console list`, you should see `ezpublish:cookbook:hello` listed in the available commands. If you run it, it will however still do nothing.

Let's just add something very simple to our `execute()` method so that our command actually does something.

**TestCommand::execute()**

``` php
protected function execute( InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output )
{
    // fetch the input argument
    if ( !$name = $input->getArgument( 'name' ) )
    {
        $name = "World";
    }
    $output->writeln( "Hello $name" );
}
```

You can now run the command from the eZ Platform root.

**Hello world**

``` bash
$ php app/console ezpublish:cookbook:hello world
Hello world
```

#### Creating a custom route with a controller action

In this short chapter, we will see how to create a new route that will catch a custom URL and execute a controller action. We want to create a new route, `/cookbook/test`, that displays a simple 'Hello world' message. This tutorial is a simplified version of the official one that can be found on <http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/controller.html>.

During our bundle's generation, we have chosen to generate the bundle with default code snippets. Fortunately, almost everything we need is part of those snippets. We just need to do some editing, in particular in two locations: `src/EzSystems/Resources/CookbookBundle/config/routing.yml` and `src/EzSystems/CookbookBundle/Controllers/DefaultController.php`. The first one will be used to configure our route (`/cookbook/test`) as well as the controller action the route should execute, while the latter will contain the actual action's code.

##### routing.yml

This is the file where we define our action's URL matching. The generated file contains this YAML block:

**Generated routing.yml**

``` yaml
ez_systems_cookbook_homepage:
    path:     /hello/{name}
    defaults: { _controller: EzSystemsCookbookBundle:Default:index }
```

We can safely remove this default code, and replace it with this:

**Edited routing.yml**

``` yaml
ezsystems_cookbook_hello:
    path:     /cookbook/hello/{name}
    defaults: { _controller: EzSystemsCookbookBundle:Default:hello }
```

We define a route that matches the URI /cookbook/\* and executes the action `hello` in the Default controller of our bundle. The next step is to create this method in the controller.

##### DefaultController.php

This controller was generated by the bundle generator. It contains one method, `helloAction()`, that matched the YAML configuration we have changed in the previous part. Let's just rename the `indexAction()` method so that we end up with this code.

**DefaultController::helloAction()**

``` javascript
public function helloAction( $name )
{
    $response = new \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;
    $response->setContent( "Hello $name" );
    return $response;
}
```

We won't go into details about controllers in this cookbook, but let's walk through the code a bit. This method receives the parameter defined in `routing.yml`. It is called "name" in the route definition, and must be called $name in the matching action. Since the action is named "hello" in `routing.yml`, the expected method name is `helloAction`.

Controller actions **must** return a Response object that will contain the response's content, the headers, and various optional properties that affect the action's behavior. In our case, we simply set the content, using `setContent()`, to "Hello $name". Go to http://ezplatform/cookbook/hello/YourName, and you should get "Hello YourName".

The custom EzPublishCoreBundle Controller

For convenience, a custom controller is available at [eZ\\Bundle\\EzPublishCoreBundle\\Controller](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Bundle/EzPublishCoreBundle/Controller.html). It gives you with a few commodity methods:

-   `getRepository()`
    Returns the Public API repository that gives you access to the various services through `getContentService()`, `getLocationService()` and so on;
-   `getLegacyKernel()`
    Returns an instance of the [eZ\\Publish\\Core\\MVC\\Legacy\\Kernel](http://apidoc.ez.no/doxygen/trunk/NS/html/classeZ_1_1Publish_1_1Core_1_1MVC_1_1Legacy_1_1Kernel.html) that you can use to interact with the Legacy eZ Platform kernel
-   `getConfigResolver()`
    Returns the [ConfigResolver](http://apidoc.ez.no/doxygen/trunk/NS/html/classeZ_1_1Bundle_1_1EzPublishCoreBundle_1_1DependencyInjection_1_1Configuration_1_1ConfigResolver.html) that gives you access to configuration data.

You are encouraged to use it for your custom controllers that interact with eZ Platform.

With both command line scripts and HTTP routes, you have the basics you need to start writing Public API code.

## Browsing, finding, viewing

We will start by going through the various ways to find and retrieve content from eZ Platform using the API. While this will be covered in further dedicated documentation, it is necessary to explain a few basic concepts of the Public API. In the following recipes, you will learn about the general principles of the API as they are introduced in individual recipes.

### Displaying values from a Content item

In this recipe, we will see how to fetch a Content item from the repository, and obtain its Field's content.

Let's first see the full code. You can see the Command line version at <https://github.com/ezsystems/CookbookBundle/blob/master/Command/ViewContentCommand.php>.

**Viewing content**

```php
$repository = $this->getContainer()->get( 'ezpublish.api.repository' );
$contentService = $repository->getContentService();
$contentTypeService = $repository->getContentTypeService();
$fieldTypeService = $repository->getFieldTypeService();

try
{
    $content = $contentService->loadContent( 66 );
    $contentType = $contentTypeService->loadContentType( $content->contentInfo->contentTypeId );
    // iterate over the field definitions of the content type and print out each field's identifier and value
    foreach( $contentType->fieldDefinitions as $fieldDefinition )
    {
        $output->write( $fieldDefinition->identifier . ": " );
        $fieldType = $fieldTypeService->getFieldType( $fieldDefinition->fieldTypeIdentifier );
        $field = $content->getField( $fieldDefinition->identifier );

        // We use the Field's toHash() method to get readable content out of the Field
        $valueHash = $fieldType->toHash( $field->value );
        $output->writeln( $valueHash );
    }
}
catch( \eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Exceptions\NotFoundException $e )
{
    // if the id is not found
    $output->writeln( "No content with id $contentId" );
}
catch( \eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Exceptions\UnauthorizedException $e )
{
    // not allowed to read this content
    $output->writeln( "Anonymous users are not allowed to read content with id $contentId" );
}
```

Let's analyze this code block by block.

``` php
$repository = $this->getContainer()->get( 'ezpublish.api.repository' );
$contentService = $repository->getContentService();
$contentTypeService = $repository->getContentTypeService();
$fieldTypeService = $repository->getFieldTypeService();
```

This is the initialization part. As explained above, everything in the Public API goes through the repository via dedicated services. We get the repository from the service container, using the method `get()` of our container, obtained via `$this->getContainer()`. Using our `$repository` variable, we fetch the two services we will need using `getContentService()` and `getFieldTypeService()`.

``` php
try
{
    // iterate over the field definitions of the content type and print out each field's identifier and value
    $content = $contentService->loadContent( 66 );
```

Everything starting from line 5 is about getting our Content and iterating over its Fields. You can see that the whole logic is part of a `try/catch` block. Since the Public API uses Exceptions for error handling, this is strongly encouraged, as it will allow you to conditionally catch the various errors that may happen. We will cover the exceptions we expect in a later paragraph.

The first thing we do is use the Content Service to load a Content item using its ID, 66: `$contentService->loadContent ( 66 )`. As you can see on the API doc page, this method expects a Content ID, and returns a [Content Value Object](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Content.html).

``` php
foreach( $contentType->fieldDefinitions as $fieldDefinition )
{
    // ignore ezpage
    if( $fieldDefinition->fieldTypeIdentifier == 'ezpage' )
        continue;
    $output->write( $fieldDefinition->identifier . ": " );
    $fieldType = $fieldTypeService->getFieldType( $fieldDefinition->fieldTypeIdentifier );
    $fieldValue = $content->getFieldValue( $fieldDefinition->identifier );
    $valueHash = $fieldType->toHash( $fieldValue );
    $output->writeln( $valueHash );
}
```

This block is the one that actually displays the value.

It iterates over the Content item's Fields using the Content Type's FieldDefinitions (`$contentType->fieldDefinitions`).

For each Field Definition, we start by displaying its identifier (`$fieldDefinition->identifier`). We then get the Field Type instance using the Field Type Service (`$fieldTypeService->getFieldType( $fieldDefinition->fieldTypeIdentifier )`). This method expects the requested Field Type's identifier, as a string (ezstring, ezxmltext, etc.), and returns an `eZ\Publish\API\Repository\FieldType` object.

The Field Value object is obtained using the `getFieldValue()` method of the Content Value Object which we obtained using `ContentService::loadContent()`.

Using the Field Type object, we can convert the Field Value to a hash using the `toHash()` method, provided by every Field Type. This method returns a primitive type (string, hash) out of a Field instance.

With this example, you should get a first idea on how you interact with the API. Everything is done through services, each service being responsible for a specific part of the repository (Content, Field Type, etc.).

Loading Content in different languages

Since we didn't specify any language code, our Field object is returned in the given Content item's main language.

If you want to take SiteAccess languages into account, you can take advantage of TranslationHelpers as described in [Content Rendering](Content-Rendering_31429679.html).

Otherwise if you want to use an altogether different language, you can specify a language code in the `getField()` call:

``` php
$content->getFieldValue( $fieldDefinition->identifier, 'fre-FR' )
```

**Exceptions handling**

``` php
catch ( \eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Exceptions\NotFoundException $e )
{
    $output->writeln( "<error>No content with id $contentId found</error>" );
}
catch ( \eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Exceptions\UnauthorizedException $e )
{
    $output->writeln( "<error>Permission denied on content with id $contentId</error>" );
}
```

As said earlier, the Public API uses [Exceptions](http://php.net/exceptions) to handle errors. Each method of the API may throw different exceptions, depending on what it does. Which exceptions can be thrown is usually documented for each method. In our case, `loadContent()` may throw two types of exceptions: `NotFoundException`, if the requested ID isn't found, and `UnauthorizedException` if the currently logged in user isn't allowed to view the requested content.

It is a good practice to cover each exception you expect to happen. In this case, since our Command takes the Content ID as a parameter, this ID may either not exist, or the referenced Content item may not be visible to our user. Both cases are covered with explicit error messages.

### Traversing a Location subtree

This recipe will show how to traverse a Location's subtree. The full code implements a command that takes a Location ID as an argument and recursively prints this location's subtree.

Full code

<https://github.com/ezsystems/CookbookBundle/blob/master/Command/BrowseLocationsCommand.php>

In this code, we introduce the [LocationService](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/LocationService.html). This service is used to interact with Locations. We use two methods from this service: [`loadLocation()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/LocationService.html#method_loadLocation), and `loadLocationChildren()`.

**Loading a Location**

``` php
try
{
    // load the starting location and browse
    $location = $this->locationService->loadLocation( $locationId );
    $this->browseLocation( $location, $output );
}
catch ( \eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Exceptions\NotFoundException $e )
{
    $output->writeln( "<error>No location found with id $locationId</error>" );
}
catch( \eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Exceptions\UnauthorizedException $e )
{
    $output->writeln( "<error>Current users are not allowed to read location with id $locationId</error>" );
}
```

As for the ContentService, `loadLocation()` returns a Value Object, here a `Location`. Errors are handled with exceptions: `NotFoundException` if the Location ID couldn't be found, and `UnauthorizedException` if the current repository user isn't allowed to view this Location.

**Iterating over a Location's children**

``` php
private function browseLocation( Location $location, OutputInterface $output, $depth = 0 )
{
    $childLocationList = $this->locationService->loadLocationChildren( $location, $offset = 0, $limit = -1 );
    // If offset and limit had been specified to something else then "all", then $childLocationList->totalCount contains the total count for iteration use
    foreach ( $childLocationList->locations as $childLocation )
    {
        $this->browseLocation( $childLocation, $output, $depth + 1 );
    }
}
```

`LocationService::loadLocationChildren()` returns a [LocationList](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/LocationList.php) Value Objects that we can iterate over.

Note that unlike `loadLocation()`, we don't need to care for permissions here: the currently logged-in user's permissions will be respected when loading children, and Locations that can't be viewed won't be returned at all.

!!! note "Full code"

    Should you need more advanced children fetching methods, the `SearchService` is what you are looking for.

### Viewing Content Metadata

Content is a central piece in the Public API. You will often need to start from a Content item, and dig in from its metadata. Basic content metadata is made available through `ContentInfo` objects. This Value Object mostly provides primitive fields: `contentTypeId`, `publishedDate` or `mainLocationId`. But it is also used to request further Content-related Value Objects from various services.

The full example implements an `ezpublish:cookbook:view_content_metadata` command that prints out all the available metadata, given a Content ID.

!!! note "Full code"

    <https://github.com/ezsystems/CookbookBundle/blob/master/Command/ViewContentMetaDataCommand.php>

We introduce here several new services: [`URLAliasService`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/URLAliasService.html), [`UserService`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/UserService.html) and [`SectionService`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/SectionService.html). The concept should be familiar to you now.

**Services initialization**

``` php
/** @var $repository \eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Repository */
$repository = $this->getContainer()->get( 'ezpublish.api.repository' );
$contentService = $repository->getContentService();
$locationService = $repository->getLocationService();
$urlAliasService = $repository->getURLAliasService();
$sectionService = $repository->getSectionService();
$userService = $repository->getUserService();
```

#### Setting the Repository User

In a command line script, the repository runs as if executed by the anonymous user. In order to identify it as a different user, you need to use the `UserService` as follows (in this example `14` is the ID of the administrator user):

``` php
$administratorUser = $userService->loadUser( 14 );
$repository->setCurrentUser( $administratorUser );
```

This may be crucial when writing maintenance or synchronization scripts.

This is of course not required in template functions or controller code, as the HTTP layer will take care of identifying the user, and automatically set it in the repository.

Since v1.6.0, as the `setCurrentUser` method is deprecated, you need to use the following code (here for the `admin` user, to be replaced with a different login as needed):

``` php
$permissionResolver = $repository->getPermissionResolver();
$user = $userService->loadUserByLogin('admin');
$permissionResolver->setCurrentUserReference($user);
```

#### The ContentInfo Value Object

We will now load a `ContentInfo` object using the provided ID and use it to get our Content item's metadata

``` php
$contentInfo = $contentService->loadContentInfo( $contentId );
```

#### Locations

**Getting Content Locations**

``` php
// show all locations of the content
$locations = $locationService->loadLocations( $contentInfo );
$output->writeln( "<info>LOCATIONS</info>" );
foreach ( $locations as $location )
{
    $urlAlias = $urlAliasService->reverseLookup( $location );
    $output->writeln( "  $location->pathString  ($urlAlias->path)" );
}
```

We first use `LocationService::loadLocations()` to **get** the **Locations** for our `ContentInfo`. This method returns an array of [`Location`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Location.html) Value Objects. In this example, we print out the Location's path string (/path/to/content). We also use [URLAliasService::reverseLookup()](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/URLAliasService.html#method_reverseLookup) to get the Location's main [URLAlias](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/URLAlias.html).

#### Relations

We now want to list relations from and to our Content. Since relations are versioned, we need to feed the [`ContentService::loadRelations()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/ContentService.html#method_loadRelations) with a `VersionInfo` object. We can get the current version's `VersionInfo` using [`ContentService::loadVersionInfo()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/ContentService.html#method_loadVersionInfo). If we had been looking for an archived version, we could have specified the version number as the second argument to this method.

**Browsing a Content's relations**

``` php
// show all relations of the current version
$versionInfo = $contentService->loadVersionInfo( $contentInfo );
$relations = $contentService->loadRelations( $versionInfo );
if ( !empty( $relations ) )
{
    $output->writeln( "<info>RELATIONS</info>" );
    foreach ( $relations as $relation )
    {
        $name = $relation->destinationContentInfo->name;
        $output->write( "  Relation of type " . $this->outputRelationType( $relation->type ) . " to content $name" );
    }
}
```

We can iterate over the [Relation](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Relation.html) objects array we got from `loadRelations()`, and use these Value Objects to get data about our relations. It has two main properties: `destinationContentInfo`, and `sourceContentInfo`. They also hold the relation type (embed, common, etc.), and the optional Field this relations is made with.

#### ContentInfo properties

We can of course get our Content item's metadata by using the Value Object's properties.

**Primitive object metadata**

``` php
// show meta data
$output->writeln( "\n<info>METADATA</info>" );
$output->writeln( "  <info>Name:</info> " . $contentInfo->name );
$output->writeln( "  <info>Type:</info> " . $contentType->identifier );
$output->writeln( "  <info>Last modified:</info> " . $contentInfo->modificationDate->format( 'Y-m-d' ) );
$output->writeln( "  <info>Published:</info> ". $contentInfo->publishedDate->format( 'Y-m-d' ) );
$output->writeln( "  <info>RemoteId:</info> $contentInfo->remoteId" );
$output->writeln( "  <info>Main Language:</info> $contentInfo->mainLanguageCode" );
$output->writeln( "  <info>Always available:</info> " . ( $contentInfo->alwaysAvailable ? 'Yes' : 'No' ) );
```

#### Owning user

We can use [`UserService::loadUser()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/UserService.html#method_loadUser) with Content `ownerId` property of our `ContentInfo` to load the Content's owner as a `User` Value Object.

``` php
$owner = $userService->loadUser( $contentInfo->ownerId );
$output->writeln( "  <info>Owner:</info> " . $owner->contentInfo->name );
```

To get the current version's creator, and not the content's owner, you need to use the `creatorId` property from the current version's `VersionInfo` object.

#### Section

The Section's ID can be found in the `sectionId` property of the `ContentInfo` object. To get the matching Section Value Object, you need to use the `SectionService::loadSection()` method.

``` php
$section = $sectionService->loadSection( $contentInfo->sectionId );
$output->writeln( "  <info>Section:</info> $section->name" );
```

#### Versions

To conclude we can also iterate over the Content's version, as `VersionInfo` Value Objects.

``` php
$versionInfoArray = $contentService->loadVersions( $contentInfo );
if ( !empty( $versionInfoArray ) )
{
    $output->writeln( "\n<info>VERSIONS</info>" );
    foreach ( $versionInfoArray as $versionInfo )
    {
        $creator = $userService->loadUser( $versionInfo->creatorId );
        $output->write( "  Version $versionInfo->versionNo " );
        $output->write( " by " . $creator->contentInfo->name );
        $output->writeln( " " . $this->outputStatus( $versionInfo->status ) . " " . $versionInfo->initialLanguageCode );
    }
}
```

We use the `ContentService::loadVersions()` method and get an array of `VersionInfo` objects.

### Search

In this section we will cover how the [`SearchService`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/SearchService.html) can be used to search for Content, by using a [`Query`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Query.html) and a combinations of [`Criteria`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Query/Criterion.html) you will get a [`SearchResult`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Search/SearchResult.html) object back containing list of Content and count of total hits. In the future this object will also include facets, spell checking and "more like this" when running on a backend that supports it *(for instance Solr)*.

!!! note

    To actually find anything using API described in this section, you need to create some content (articles, folders) under eZ Platform root.

##### Difference between filter and query

Query object contains two properties you can set criteria on, `filter` and `query`, and while you can mix and match use and use both at the same time, there is one distinction between the two:

-   `query:` Has an effect on scoring *(relevancy)* calculation, and thus also on the default sorting if no `sortClause` is specified, *when used with Solr and Elastic.*
    -   Typically you'll use this for `FullText` search criterion, and otherwise place everything else on `filter`.

#### Performing a simple full text search

Full code

<https://github.com/ezsystems/CookbookBundle/blob/master/Command/FindContentCommand.php>

In this recipe, we will run a simple full text search over every compatible attribute.

##### Query and Criterion objects

We introduce here a new object: `Query`. It is used to build up a Content query based on a set of `Criterion` objects.

```php
$query = new \eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\Content\Query();
// Use 'query' over 'filter' for FullText to get hit score (relevancy) with Solr/Elastic
$query->query = new Query\Criterion\FullText( $text );
```



Multiple criteria can be grouped together using "logical criteria", such as [LogicalAnd](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Query/Criterion/LogicalAnd.html) or [LogicalOr](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Query/Criterion/LogicalOr.html). Since in this case we only want to run a text search, we simply use a [`FullText`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Query/Criterion/FullText.html) criterion object.

The full list of criteria can be found on your installation in the following directory [vendor/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Query/Criterion](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/tree/master/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Query/Criterion). Additionally you may look at integration tests like [vendor/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Tests/SearchServiceTest.php](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Tests/SearchServiceTest.php) for more details on how these are used.

##### Running the search query and using the results

The `Query` object is given as an argument to [`SearchService::findContent()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/SearchService.html#method_findContent). This method returns a `SearchResult` object. This object provides you with various information about the search operation (number of results, time taken, spelling suggestions, or facets, as well as, of course, the results themselves.

``` php
$result = $searchService->findContent( $query );
$output->writeln( 'Found ' . $result->totalCount . ' items' );
foreach ( $result->searchHits as $searchHit )
{
    $output->writeln( $searchHit->valueObject->contentInfo->name );
}
```

The `searchHits` properties of the `SearchResult` object is an array of `SearchHit` objects. In `valueObject` property of `SearchHit`, you will find the `Content` object that matches the given `Query`.

Tip

 If you you are searching using a unique identifier, for instance using the Content ID or Content remote ID criterion, then you can use [`SearchService::findSingle()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/SearchService.html#method_findSingle), this takes a Criterion and returns a single Content item, or throws a `NotFound` exception if none is found.



#### Retrieving Sort Clauses for parent location

You can use the method $parentL`ocation->getSortClauses()` to return an array of Sort Clauses for direct use on `LocationQuery->sortClauses`.

#### Performing an advanced search

Full code

<https://github.com/ezsystems/CookbookBundle/blob/master/Command/FindContent2Command.php>

As explained in the previous chapter, Criterion objects are grouped together using logical criteria. We will now see how multiple criteria objects can be combined into a fine grained search `Query`.

``` php
use eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\Content\Query\Criterion;
use eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\Content\Query;

// [...]

$query = new Query();
$criterion1 = new Criterion\Subtree( $locationService->loadLocation( 2 )->pathString );
$criterion2 = new Criterion\ContentTypeIdentifier( 'folder' );
$query->filter = new Criterion\LogicalAnd(
    array( $criterion1, $criterion2 )
);

$result = $searchService->findContent( $query );
```

A [`Subtree`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Query/Criterion/Subtree.html) criterion limits the search to the subtree with pathString, which looks like: `/1/2/`. A [`ContentTypeId`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Query/Criterion/ContentTypeId.html) Criterion to limit the search to Content of Content Type 1. Those two criteria are grouped with a `LogicalAnd` operator. The query is executed as before, with `SearchService::findContent()`.

##### Fine-tuning search results

###### `$languageFilter`

The `$languageFilter` parameter provides a prioritized list of languages for the current SiteAccess. Passing it is recommended for front-end use, because otherwise all languages of the Content items will be returned.

Additionally, you can make use of the `useAlwaysAvailable` argument of the $`languageFilter`. This in turn uses the `alwaysAvailable` flag whose default is set on Content Type. When it is set to `true`, it ensures that when a language from the prioritized list can't be matched, the Content will be returned in its main language.

###### `Criterion\Visibility`

`Criterion\Visibility` enables you to ensure that only visible content will be returned.

Note that the criterion behaves differently depending on the method you use, because Locations have visibility, but Content does not. This means that when using the `LocationQuery` (`findLocations($query)`), the method will return the Location, if it is visible. When used with the `Query` (`findContent($query)`), however, the Content item will be returned even if one of its Locations is visible (although others may be hidden). That is why using `Criterion\Visibility` is recommended with `LocationQuery`.

This example shows the usage of both `$languageFilter` and `Criterion\Visibility`:

``` php
$query = new LocationQuery([
    'filter' => new Criterion\LogicalAnd([
    new Criterion\Visibility(Criterion\Visibility::VISIBLE),
    new Criterion\ParentLocationId($parentLocation->id),
    ];),
    'sortClauses' => $parentLocation->getSortClauses(),
]);
$searchService->findLocations($query,
    ['languages' => $configResolver->getParameter('languages')]);
```

#### Performing a fetch like search

Full code

<https://github.com/ezsystems/CookbookBundle/blob/master/Command/FindContent3Command.php>

A search isn't only meant for searching, it also provides the interface for what was called "fetch" in eZ Publish 4.x. As this is totally back-end agnostic, eZ Publish's "ezfind" fetch functions are now powered by Solr (or ElasticSearch in experimental, unsupported setups).

Following the examples above we now change it a bit to combine several criteria with both an AND and an OR condition.

``` javascript
use eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\Content\Query\Criterion;
use eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\Content\Query;

// [...]

$query = new Query();
$query->filter = new Criterion\LogicalAnd(
    array(
        new Criterion\ParentLocationId( 2 ),
        new Criterion\LogicalOr(
            array(
                new Criterion\ContentTypeIdentifier( 'folder' ),
                new Criterion\ContentTypeId( 2 )
            )
        )
    )
);

$result = $searchService->findContent( $query );
```

A `ParentLocationId` criterion limits the search to the children of location 2. An array of "`ContentTypeId"` Criteria to limit the search to Content of ContentType's with id 1 or 2 grouped in a `LogicalOr` operator. Those two criteria are grouped with a `LogicalAnd` operator. As always the query is executed as before, with `SearchService::findContent()`.

Want to do a subtree filter? Change the location filter to use the Subtree criterion filter as shown in the advanced search example above.

##### Using in() instead of OR

The above example is fine, but it can be optimized a bit by taking advantage of the fact that all filter criteria support being given an array of values (IN operator) instead of a single value (EQ operator).

You can also use the [`ContentTypeIdentifier`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Query/Criterion/ContentTypeIdentifier.html) Criterion:

``` php
use eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\Content\Query\Criterion;
use eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\Content\Query;

// [...]

$query = new Query();
$query->filter = new Criterion\LogicalAnd(
    array(
        new Criterion\ParentLocationId( 2 ),
        new Criterion\ContentTypeIdentifier( array( 'article', 'folder' ) )
    )
);

$result = $searchService->findContent( $query );
```

!!! tip

    All filter criteria are capable of doing an "IN" selection, the ParentLocationId above could, for example, have been provided "array( 2, 43 )" to include second level children in both your content tree (2) and your media tree (43).

#### Performing a Faceted Search

!!! note "Under construction"

    Faceted Search is not fully implemented yet.

    -   Implemented Facets SOLR BUNDLE &gt;=1.4: `User, ContentType, & Section` , see:   [![](https://jira.ez.no/images/icons/issuetypes/epic.png)EZP-26465](https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-26465?src=confmacro) - Search Facets M1 Development
    -   Not Implemented Facets: `CriterionFacet, DateRangeFacet, FieldFacet, FieldRangeFacet, LocationFacet (meant for Location search), & TermFacet`

    You can register [custom facet builder visitors](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-solr-search-engine/blob/v1.1.1/lib/Resources/config/container/solr/facet_builder_visitors.yml) with Solr for Content(Info) and SOLR BUNDLE &gt;=1.4 Location search.

    **Contribution starting point**

    The link above is also the starting point for contributing visitors for other API [FacetBuilders](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/tree/master/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Query/FacetBuilder) and [Facets](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/tree/master/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Search/Facet) . As for integration tests, fixtures that will need adjustments are found in [ezpublish-kernel](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/tree/master/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Tests/_fixtures/Solr) , and those missing in that link but [defined in SearchServiceTest](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Tests/SearchServiceTest.php#L2474), are basically not implemented yet.

To be able to take advantage of facets, we can set the `Query->facetBuilders` property, which will result in relevant facets being returned on `SearchResult->facets`. All facet builders share the following properties:

-   `name`: Recommended, to set the human readable name of the returned facet for use in UI, so if you need translation this value should already be translated.
-   `minCount`: Optional, the minimum of hits of a given grouping, e.g. minimum number of content items in a given facet for it to be returned
-   `limit`: Optional, Maximum number of facets to be returned; only X number of facets with the greatest number of hits will be returned.

As an example, let's `apply UserFacet` to be able to group content according to the creator:

``` php
use eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\Content\Query\Criterion;
use eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\Content\Query\FacetBuilder;

// [...]

$query = new Query();
$query->filter = new Criterion\ContentTypeIdentifier(['article']);
$query->facetBuilders[] = new FacetBuilder\UserFacetBuilder(
    [
        'name' => 'Document owner',
        'type' => FacetBuilder\UserFacetBuilder::OWNER,// Specific to UserFacetBuilder, one of: OWNER, GROUP or MODIFIER
        'minCount' => 2,
        'limit' => 5
    ]
);

$result = $searchService->findContentInfo( $query );
list( $userId, $articleCount ) = $result->facets[0]->entries;
```

#### Performing a pure search count

In many cases you might need the number of Content items matching a search, but with no need to do anything else with the results.

Thanks to the fact that the "searchHits" property of the [`SearchResult`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Search/SearchResult.html) object always refers to the total amount, it is enough to run a standard search and set $limit to 0. This way no results will be retrieved, and the search will not be slowed down, even when the number of matching results is huge.

``` php
use eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\Content\Query;

// [...]

$query = new Query();
$query->limit = 0;

// [...] ( Add criteria as shown above )

$resultCount = $searchService->findContent( $query )->totalCount;
```

## Managing Content

In the following recipes, you will see how to create Content, including complex fields like XmlText or Image.

### Identifying to the repository with a login and a password

As seen earlier, the Repository executes operations with a user's credentials. In a web context, the currently logged-in user is automatically identified. In a command line context, you need to manually log a user in. We have already seen how to manually load and set a user using its ID. If you would like to identify a user using their username and password instead, this can be achieved in the following way:

**authentication**

``` php
$user = $userService->loadUserByCredentials( $username, $password );
$repository->setCurrentUser( $user );
```

Since v1.6.0, as the `setCurrentUser` method is deprecated, you need to use the following code:

**authentication**

``` php
$permissionResolver = $repository->getPermissionResolver();
$user = $userService->loadUserByCredentials( $username, $password );
$permissionResolver->setCurrentUserReference($user);
```

### Creating content

!!! note "Full code"

    <https://github.com/ezsystems/CookbookBundle/blob/master/Command/CreateContentCommand.php>

We will now see how to create Content using the Public API. This example will work with the default Folder (ID 1) Content Type from eZ Platform.

``` php
/** @var $repository \eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Repository */
$repository = $this->getContainer()->get( 'ezpublish.api.repository' );
$contentService = $repository->getContentService();
$locationService = $repository->getLocationService();
$contentTypeService = $repository->getContentTypeService();
```

We first need the required services. In this case: `ContentService`, `LocationService` and `ContentTypeService`.

#### The ContentCreateStruct

As explained in [above](#value-info-objects), Value Objects are read only. Dedicated objects are provided for Update and Create operations: structs, like `ContentCreateStruct` or `UpdateCreateStruct`. In this case, we need to use a `ContentCreateStruct`.

``` php
$contentType = $contentTypeService->loadContentTypeByIdentifier( 'article' );
$contentCreateStruct = $contentService->newContentCreateStruct( $contentType, 'eng-GB' );
```

We first need to get the [`ContentType`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/ContentType/ContentType.html) we want to create a `Content` with. To do so, we use [`ContentTypeService::loadContentTypeByIdentifier()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/ContentTypeService.html#method_loadContentTypeByIdentifier), with the wanted `ContentType` identifier, like 'article'. We finally get a ContentTypeCreateStruct using [`ContentService::newContentCreateStruct()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/ContentService.html#method_newContentCreateStruct), providing the Content Type and a Locale Code (eng-GB).

#### Setting the fields values

``` php
$contentCreateStruct->setField( 'title', 'My title' );
$contentCreateStruct->setField( 'intro', $intro );
$contentCreateStruct->setField( 'body', $body );
```

Using our create struct, we can now set the values for our Content item's Fields, using the [`setField()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/ContentCreateStruct.html#method_setField) method. For now, we will just set the title. `setField()` for a TextLine Field simply expects a string as input argument. More complex Field Types, like Author or Image, expect different input values.

The `ContentCreateStruct::setField()` method can take several type of arguments.

In any case, whatever the Field Type is, a Value of this type can be provided. For instance, a TextLine\\Value can be provided for a TextLine\\Type. Depending on the Field Type implementation itself, more specifically on the `fromHash()` method every Field Type implements, various arrays can be accepted, as well as primitive types, depending on the Type.

#### Setting the Location

In order to set a Location for our object, we must instantiate a [`LocationCreateStruct`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/LocationCreateStruct.html). This is done with `LocationService::newLocationCreateStruct()`, with the new Location's parent ID as an argument.

``` php
$locationCreateStruct = $locationService->newLocationCreateStruct( 2 );
```

#### Creating and publishing

To actually create our Content in the Repository, we need to use `ContentService::createContent()`. This method expects a `ContentCreateStruct`, as well as a `LocationCreateStruct`. We have created both in the previous steps.

``` php
$draft = $contentService->createContent( $contentCreateStruct, array( $locationCreateStruct ) );
$content = $contentService->publishVersion( $draft->versionInfo );
```

The LocationCreateStruct is provided as an array, since a Content item can have multiple locations.

`createContent()`returns a new Content Value Object, with one version that has the DRAFT status. To make this Content visible, we need to publish it. This is done using `ContentService::publishVersion()`. This method expects a `VersionInfo` object as its parameter. In our case, we simply use the current version from `$draft`, with the `versionInfo` property.

### Updating Content

Full code

<https://github.com/ezsystems/CookbookBundle/blob/master/Command/UpdateContentCommand.php>

We will now see how the previously created Content can be updated. To do so, we will create a new draft for our Content, update it using a [`ContentUpdateStruct`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/ContentUpdateStruct.html), and publish the updated Version.

``` php
$contentInfo = $contentService->loadContentInfo( $contentId );
$contentDraft = $contentService->createContentDraft( $contentInfo );
```

To create our draft, we need to load the Content item's ContentInfo using `ContentService::loadContentInfo()`. We can then use `ContentService::createContentDraft()` to add a new Draft to our Content.

``` php
// instantiate a content update struct and set the new fields
$contentUpdateStruct = $contentService->newContentUpdateStruct();
$contentUpdateStruct->initialLanguageCode = 'eng-GB'; // set language for new version
$contentUpdateStruct->setField( 'title', $newTitle );
$contentUpdateStruct->setField( 'body', $newBody );
```

To set the new values for this version, we request a `ContentUpdateStruct` from the `ContentService` using the `newContentUpdateStruct()` method. Updating the values hasn't changed: we use the `setField()` method.

``` php
$contentDraft = $contentService->updateContent( $contentDraft->versionInfo, $contentUpdateStruct );
$content = $contentService->publishVersion( $contentDraft->versionInfo );
```

We can now use `ContentService::updateContent()` to apply our `ContentUpdateStruct` to our draft's `VersionInfo`. Publishing is done exactly the same way as for a new content, using `ContentService::publishVersion()`.

### Handling translations

In the two previous examples, you have seen that we set the ContentUpdateStruct's `initialLanguageCode` property. To translate an object to a new language, set the locale to a new one.

**translating**

``` php
$contentUpdateStruct->initialLanguageCode = 'ger-DE';
$contentUpdateStruct->setField( 'title', $newtitle );
$contentUpdateStruct->setField( 'body', $newbody );
```

It is possible to create or update content in multiple languages at once. There is one restriction: only one language can be set a version's language. This language is the one that will get a flag in the back office. However, you can set values in other languages for your attributes, using the `setField` method's third argument.

**update multiple languages**

``` php
// set one language for new version
$contentUpdateStruct->initialLanguageCode = 'fre-FR';

$contentUpdateStruct->setField( 'title', $newgermantitle, 'ger-DE' );
$contentUpdateStruct->setField( 'body', $newgermanbody, 'ger-DE' );

$contentUpdateStruct->setField( 'title', $newfrenchtitle );
$contentUpdateStruct->setField( 'body', $newfrenchbody );
```

Since we don't specify a locale for the last two fields, they are set for the `UpdateStruct`'s `initialLanguageCode`, fre-FR.

### Creating Content containing an image

!!! note "Full code"

    <https://github.com/ezsystems/CookbookBundle/blob/master/Command/CreateImageCommand.php>

As explained above, the `setField()` method can accept various values: an instance of the Field Type's Value class, a primitive type, or a hash. The last two depend on what the `Type::acceptValue()` method is build up to handle. TextLine can, for instance, accept a simple string as an input value. In this example, you will see how to set an Image value.

We assume that we use the default image class. Creating our Content, using the Content Type and a ContentCreateStruct, has been covered above, and can be found in the full code. Let's focus on how the image is provided.

``` php
$file = '/path/to/image.png';

$value = new \eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\Image\Value(
    array(
        'path' => '/path/to/image.png',
        'fileSize' => filesize( '/path/to/image.png' ),
        'fileName' => basename( 'image.png' ),
        'alternativeText' => 'My image'
    )
);
$contentCreateStruct->setField( 'image', $value );
```

This time, we create our image by directly providing an [`Image\Value`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/Core/FieldType/Image/Value.html) object. The values are directly provided to the constructor using a hash with predetermined keys that depend on each Type. In this case: the path where the image can be found, its size, the file name, and an alternative text.

Images also implement a static [`fromString()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/Core/FieldType/Image/Value.html#method_fromString) method that will, given a path to an image, return an `Image\Value` object.

``` php
$value = \eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\Image\Value::fromString( '/path/to/image.png' );
```

But as said before, whatever you provide `setField()` with is sent to the `acceptValue()` method. This method really is the entry point to the input formats a Field Type accepts. In this case, you could have provided setField with either a hash, similar to the one we provided the Image\\Value constructor with, or the path to your image, as a string.

``` php
$contentCreateStruct->setField( 'image', '/path/to/image.png' );

// or

$contentCreateStruct->setField( 'image', array(
    'path' => '/path/to/image.png',
    'fileSize' => filesize( '/path/to/image.png' ),
    'fileName' => basename( 'image.png' ),
    'alternativeText' => 'My image'
);
```

### Create Content with XML Text

!!! note "Full code"

    <https://github.com/ezsystems/CookbookBundle/blob/master/Command/CreateXMLContentCommand.php>

Another very commonly used Field Type is the rich text one, `XmlText`.

**working with xml text**

``` php
$xmlText = <<< EOX
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<section>
<paragraph>This is a <strong>image test</strong></paragraph>
<paragraph><embed view='embed' size='medium' object_id='$imageId'/></paragraph>
</section>
EOX;
$contentCreateStruct->setField( 'body', $xmlText );
```

As for the last example above, we use the multiple formats accepted by `setField()`, and provide our XML string as is. The only accepted format as of 5.0 is internal XML, the one stored in the Legacy database.

!!! note

    The XSD for the internal XML representation can be found in the kernel: <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/eZ/Publish/Core/FieldType/XmlText/Input/Resources/schemas/ezxml.xsd>.

We embed an image in our XML, using the `<embed>` tag, providing an image Content ID as the `object_id` attribute.

!!! note "Using a custom format as input"

    More input formats will be added later. The API for that is actually already available: you simply need to implement the [`XmlText\Input`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/Core/FieldType/XmlText/Input.html) interface. It contains one method, [`getInternalRepresentation()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/Core/FieldType/XmlText/Input.html#method_getInternalRepresentation), that must return an internal XML string. Create your own bundle, add your implementation to it, and use it in your code!

``` php
$input = new \My\XmlText\CustomInput( 'My custom format string' );
$contentCreateStruct->setField( 'body', $input );
```

### Deleting Content

``` php
$contentService->deleteContent( $contentInfo );
```

[`ContentService::deleteContent()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/ContentService.html#method_deleteContent) method expects a `ContentInfo` as an argument. It will delete the given Content item, all of its Locations, as well as all of the Content item's Locations' descendants and their associated Content.

!!! caution

    Use with caution!

## Working with Locations

### Adding a new Location to a Content item

Full code

<https://github.com/ezsystems/CookbookBundle/blob/master/Command/AddLocationToContentCommand.php>

We have seen earlier how you can create a Location for a newly created `Content`. It is of course also possible to add a new [`Location`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Location.html) to an existing `Content`.

``` php
try
{
    $locationCreateStruct = $locationService->newLocationCreateStruct( $parentLocationId );
    $contentInfo = $contentService->loadContentInfo( $contentId );
    $newLocation = $locationService->createLocation( $contentInfo, $locationCreateStruct );
    print_r( $newLocation );
}
// Content or location not found
catch ( \eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Exceptions\NotFoundException $e )
{
    $output->writeln( $e->getMessage() );
}
// Permission denied
catch ( \eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Exceptions\UnauthorizedException $e )
{
    $output->writeln( $e->getMessage() );
}
```

This is the required code. As you can see, both the ContentService and the LocationService are involved. Errors are handled the usual way, by intercepting the Exceptions the used methods may throw.

``` php
$locationCreateStruct = $locationService->newLocationCreateStruct( $parentLocationId );
```

Like we do when creating a new Content item, we need to get a new `LocationCreateStruct`. We will use it to set our new [`Location`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Location.html)'s properties. The new Location's parent ID is provided as a parameter to `LocationService::newLocationCreateStruct`.

In this example, we use the default values for the various `LocationCreateStruct` properties. We could of course have set custom values, like setting the Location as hidden ($location-&gt;hidden = true), or changed the remoteId (`$location->remoteId = $myRemoteId`).

``` php
$contentInfo = $contentService->loadContentInfo( $contentId );
```

To add a Location to a Content item, we need to specify the Content, using a [`ContentInfo`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/ContentInfo.html) object. We load one using `ContentService::loadContentInfo()`, using the Content ID as the argument.

``` php
$newLocation = $locationService->createLocation( $contentInfo, $locationCreateStruct );
```

We finally use `LocationService::createLocation()`, providing the `ContentInfo` obtained above, together with our `LocationCreateStruct`. The method returns the newly created Location Value Object.

### Hide/Unhide Location

!!! note "Full code"

    <https://github.com/ezsystems/CookbookBundle/blob/master/Command/HideLocationCommand.php>

We mentioned earlier that a Location's visibility could be set while creating the Location, using the hidden property of the LocationCreateStruct. Changing a Location's visibility may have a large impact in the Repository: doing so will affect the Location's subtree visibility. For this reason, a `LocationUpdateStruct` doesn't let you toggle this property. You need to use the `LocationService` to do so.

``` php
$hiddenLocation = $locationService->hideLocation( $location );
$unhiddenLocation = $locationService->unhideLocation( $hiddenLocation );
```

There are two methods for this: `LocationService::hideLocation`, and `LocationService::unhideLocation()`. Both expect the `LocationInfo` as their argument, and return the modified Location Value Object.

The explanation above is valid for most Repository objects. Modification of properties that affect other parts of the system will require that you use a custom service method.

### Deleting a Location

Deleting Locations can be done in two ways: delete, or trash.

``` php
$locationService->deleteLocation( $locationInfo );
```

[`LocationService::deleteLocation()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/LocationService.html#method_deleteLocation) will permanently delete the Location, as well as all its descendants. Content that has only one Location will be permanently deleted as well. Those with more than one won't be, as they are still referenced by at least one Location.

``` php
$trashService->trash( $locationInfo );
```

`TrashService::trash()` will send the Location as well as all its descendants to the Trash, where they can be found and restored until the Trash is emptied. Content isn't affected at all, since it is still referenced by the trash items.

The `TrashService` can be used to list, restore and delete Locations that were previously sent to Trash using [`TrashService::trash()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/TrashService.html#method_trash).

### Setting a content item's main Location

This is done using the `ContentService`, by updating the `ContentInfo` with a `ContentUpdateStruct` that sets the new main location:

``` php
$repository = $this->getContainer()->get( 'ezpublish.api.repository' );
$contentService = $repository->getContentService();
$contentInfo = $contentService->loadContentInfo( $contentId );

$contentUpdateStruct = $contentService->newContentMetadataUpdateStruct();
$contentUpdateStruct->mainLocationId = 123;

$contentService->updateContentMetadata( $contentInfo, $contentUpdateStruct );
```

## Other recipes

### Assigning Section to content

!!! note "Full code"

    [https://github.com/ezsystems/CookbookBundle/tree/master/Command/AssignContentToSectionCommand.php](https://github.com/docb22/ez-publish-cookbook/tree/master/EzSystems/CookBookBundle/Command/AssignContentToSectionCommand.php)

The Section that a Content item belongs to can be set during creation, using the `ContentCreateStruct::$sectionId` property. However, as for many Repository objects properties, the Section can't be changed using a `ContentUpdateStruct`. The reason is still the same: changing a Content item's Section will affect the subtrees referenced by its Locations. For this reason, it is required that you use the SectionService to change the Section of a Content item.

**assign section to content**

``` php
$contentInfo = $contentService->loadContentInfo( $contentId );
$section = $sectionService->loadSection( $sectionId );
$sectionService->assignSection( $contentInfo, $section );
```

This operation involves the `SectionService`, as well as the `ContentService`.

**assign section to content**

``` php
$contentInfo = $contentService->loadContentInfo( $contentId );
```

We use `ContentService::loadContentInfo()` to get the Content we want to update the Section for.

**assign section to content**

``` php
$section = $sectionService->loadSection( $sectionId );
```

`SectionService::loadSection()` is then used to load the Section we want to assign our Content to. Note that there is no `SectionInfo` object. Sections are quite simple, and we don't need to separate their metadata from their actual data. However, `SectionCreateStruct` and [`SectionUpdateStruct`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/SectionUpdateStruct.html) objects must still be used to create and update Sections.

**assign section to content**

``` php
$sectionService->assignSection( $contentInfo, $section );
```

The actual update operation is done using `SectionService::assignSection()`, with the `ContentInfo` and the Section as arguments.

`SectionService::assignSection()` won't return the updated Content, as it has no knowledge of those objects. To get the Content with the newly assigned Location, you need to reload the `ContentInfo` using [`ContentService::loadContentInfo()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/ContentService.html#method_loadContentInfo). This is also valid for descendants of the Content item. If you have any stored in your execution state, you need to reload them. Otherwise you would be using outdated Content data.

### Creating a Content Type

!!! note "Full code"

    <https://github.com/ezsystems/CookbookBundle/blob/master/Command/CreateContentTypeCommand.php>

Creating a `ContentType` is actually almost more complex than creating Content. It really isn't as common, and didn't "deserve" the same kind of API as Content did.

Let's split the code in three major parts.

``` php
try
{
    $contentTypeGroup = $contentTypeService->loadContentTypeGroupByIdentifier( 'content' );
}
catch ( \eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Exceptions\NotFoundException $e )
{
    $output->writeln( "content type group with identifier $groupIdentifier not found" );
    return;
}


$contentTypeCreateStruct = $contentTypeService->newContentTypeCreateStruct( 'mycontenttype' );
$contentTypeCreateStruct->mainLanguageCode = 'eng-GB';
$contentTypeCreateStruct->nameSchema = '<title>';
$contentTypeCreateStruct->names = array(
    'eng-GB' => 'My content type'
);
$contentTypeCreateStruct->descriptions = array(
    'eng-GB' => 'Description for my content type',
);
```

First, we need to load the `ContentTypeGroup` our `ContentType` will be created in. We do this using [`ContentTypeService::loadContentTypeGroupByIdentifier()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/ContentTypeService.html#method_loadContentTypeGroupByIdentifier), which gives us back a `ContentTypeGroup` object. As for content, we then request a `ContentTypeCreateStruct` from the `ContentTypeService`, using `ContentTypeService::newContentTypeCreateStruct()`, with the desired identifier as the argument.

Using the create struct's properties, we can set the Type's properties:

-   the main language (`mainLanguageCode`) for the Type is set to eng-GB,
-   the content name generation pattern (`nameSchema`) is set to '&lt;title&gt;': Content items of this type will be named the same as their 'title' field.
-   the human-readable name for our Type is set using the `names` property. We give it a hash, indexed by the locale ('eng-GB') the name is set in. This locale must exist in the system.
-   the same way that we have set the `names` property, we can set human-readable descriptions, again as hashes indexed by locale code.

The next big part is to add FieldDefinition objects to our Content Type.

```php
// add a TextLine Field with identifier 'title'
$titleFieldCreateStruct = $contentTypeService->newFieldDefinitionCreateStruct( 'title', 'ezstring' );
$titleFieldCreateStruct->names = array( 'eng-GB' => 'Title' );
$titleFieldCreateStruct->descriptions = array( 'eng-GB' => 'The Title' );
$titleFieldCreateStruct->fieldGroup = 'content';
$titleFieldCreateStruct->position = 10;
$titleFieldCreateStruct->isTranslatable = true;
$titleFieldCreateStruct->isRequired = true;
$titleFieldCreateStruct->isSearchable = true;
$contentTypeCreateStruct->addFieldDefinition( $titleFieldCreateStruct );


// add a TextLine Field body field
$bodyFieldCreateStruct = $contentTypeService->newFieldDefinitionCreateStruct( 'body', 'ezstring' );
$bodyFieldCreateStruct->names = array( 'eng-GB' => 'Body' );
$bodyFieldCreateStruct->descriptions = array( 'eng-GB' => 'Description for Body' );
$bodyFieldCreateStruct->fieldGroup = 'content';
$bodyFieldCreateStruct->position = 20;
$bodyFieldCreateStruct->isTranslatable = true;
$bodyFieldCreateStruct->isRequired = true;
$bodyFieldCreateStruct->isSearchable = true;
$contentTypeCreateStruct->addFieldDefinition( $bodyFieldCreateStruct );
```

We need to create a `FieldDefinitionCreateStruct` object for each `FieldDefinition` our `ContentType` will be made of. Those objects are obtained using [`ContentTypeService::newFieldDefinitionCreateStruct()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/ContentTypeService.html#method_newFieldDefinitionCreateStruct). This method expects the FieldDefinition identifier and its type as arguments. The identifiers match the ones from eZ Publish 4 (`ezstring` for TextLine, etc.).

Each field's properties are set using the create struct's properties:

-   `names` and `descriptions` are set using hashes indexed by the locale code, and with the name or description as an argument.
-   The `fieldGroup` is set to 'content'
-   Fields are ordered using the `position` property, ordered numerically in ascending order. We set it to an integer.
-   The translatable, required and searchable boolean flags are set using their respective property: `isTranslatable`, `isRequired` and `isSearchable`.

Once the properties for each create struct are set, the field is added to the Content Type create struct using [`ContentTypeCreateStruct::addFieldDefinition()`](http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/ContentType/ContentTypeCreateStruct.html#method_addFieldDefinition).

``` php
try
{
    $contentTypeDraft = $contentTypeService->createContentType( $contentTypeCreateStruct, array( $contentTypeGroup ) );
    $contentTypeService->publishContentTypeDraft( $contentTypeDraft );
}
catch ( \eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Exceptions\UnauthorizedException $e )
{
    $output->writeln( "<error>" . $e->getMessage() . "</error>" );
}
catch ( \eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Exceptions\ForbiddenException $e )
{
    $output->writeln( "<error>" . $e->getMessage() . "</error>" );
}
```

The last step is the same as for Content: we create a Content Type draft using `ContentTypeService::createContentType()`, with the `ContentTypeCreateStruct` and an array of `ContentTypeGroup` objects are arguments. We then publish the Content Type draft using `ContentTypeService::publishContentTypeDraft()`.
