# Converting request parameters into API objects

In many cases, a request will provide a contentId or a locationId.
Before using them, you will have to load an API object within your controller, for example:

``` php
public function listBlogPostsAction($locationId)
{
    $location = $repository->getLocationService()->loadLocation($locationId);
```

Thanks to the ParamConverter, you can directly have the API object at your disposal. All you have to do is:

- For Locations:
    - In your controller's signature, typehint the variable to Location.
    - Make sure a parameter named "locationId" is provided by the request.
- For Content items:
    - In your controller's signature, typehint the variable to Content.
    - Make sure a parameter named "contentId" is provided by the request.

Example using Locations:

``` php
use eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\Content\Location;

public function listBlogPostsAction(Location $location)
{
    // use my $location object
```
