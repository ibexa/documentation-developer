# API

An Application Programming Interface (API) allows you to connect your code to eZ Platform.

From the eZ Blog: [How would you explain what an API is to your mom](http://ez.no/Blog/How-would-you-explain-what-an-API-is-to-your-mom)

eZ Platform offers two APIs:

1.  The [REST API](rest_api_guide.md) allows you to interact with an eZ Platform installation using the HTTP protocol, following a REST interaction model
2.  The [Public (PHP) API](public_php_api.md) exposes a Repository which allows you to create, read, update, manage and delete all objects available in eZ Platform, first and foremost content, but also related objects like sections, locations, content types, content types groups, languages and so on.

There is also a [JavaScript API Client](js_client.md), useful for working with eZ Platform as a [headless CMS](http://ez.no/Blog/Content-as-a-Service-CaaS-Decoupled-CMS-and-Headless-CMS-101).
