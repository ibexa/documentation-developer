For more information on how to manage URLs, see [URL management](../guide/url_management.md).

### Tree view in the Universal Discovery Widget

The Universal Discovery Widget, referred to as the Content Browser in User Documentation, has been updated by adding the Tree view.
You can now switch between the Grid, Panels and Tree views to browse and manage user accounts, media files, content items and forms.
Selections that you make in one view survive when you switch to the other view.

### Saving incomplete draft

When users create or edit a Content item or a Page, they can now save it without completing all the required fields.
They can then return to editing, or pass the content to another contributor.
Validation that used to happen at each save operation now, by default, happens when you click the **Publish** button.

The `ContentService::validate()` method has been added that you can use to trigger validation of individual fields 
or whole Content items for completeness at other stages of the editing process.

### Search

#### ezplatform-search

[`ezplatform-search`](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-search) is a new repository
that contains search functionalities that are not dependent on the search engine.

#### Search controller

A customizable search controller has been extracted and placed in `ezplatform-search`.

#### Searching in trash

You can now search through the contents of Trash and sort the search results based on a number of Search Criteria and Sort Clauses that can be used by the `\eZ\Publish\API\Repository\TrashService::findTrashItems` method only.

For more information, see [Searching in trash](../api/public_php_api_search.md#searching-in-trash).

### Repository filtering

[Repository filtering](../api/public_php_api_search.md#repository-filtering) enables you to filter content and Locations using a defined Filter,
without the `SearchService`.

### PermissionResolver

You can now have a Service that provides both `PermissionResolver` and `PermissionCriterionResolver` by injecting `eZ\Publish\API\Repository\PermissionService`.

## Behavior changes

### Landing Page drafts

When you start creating a Landing Page, a new draft is now automatically created.

## Deprecations

### Search engine tags

The `ezpublish.searchEngine` and `ezpublish.searchEngineIndexer` tags have been deprecated
in favor of `ezplatform.search_engine` and `ezplatform.search_engine.indexer`.
