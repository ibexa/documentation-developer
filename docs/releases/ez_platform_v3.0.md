# eZ Platform v3.0

**Version number**: v3.0

**Release date**: April 2, 2020

**Release type**: Fast Track

## Overview

## Notable changes

### Symfony 5

The version 3.0 moves eZ Platform to Symfony 5.0 from the previously used Symfony 3.4.

This entails several changes to the way projects are organized.
For details, see [Symfony 4.0](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/5.0/UPGRADE-4.0.md)
and [Symfony 5.0 upgrade documentation](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/5.0/UPGRADE-5.0.md)

### Using Events instead of SignalSlots

The application now uses Symfony Events instead of SignalSlots.
The application triggers two Events per operation: one before and one after the relevant thing happens
(see for example [BookmarkService](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-kernel/blob/v1.0.0/eZ/Publish/Core/Event/BookmarkService.php)).

To use Symfony Events, create [Event Listeners](https://symfony.com/doc/5.0/event_dispatcher.html) in your code.

### New bundles

The list of bundles in v3.0 has been extended by the following ones:

- [`ezplatform-calendar`](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-calendar)
- [`ezplatform-content-forms`](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-content-forms)
- [`ezplatform-kernel`](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-kernel)
- [`ezplatform-rest`](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-rest)
- [`ezplatform-site-factory`](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-site-factory)
- [`ezplatform-version-comparison`](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-version-comparison)

For details, see [Bundles](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/guide/bundles).
