### New ways to add images in Online Editor

You can now drag and drop images directly into the Online Editor. 
To achieve the same result, you can also click the **Upload image** button and select file from the disk.
Images that you upload this way are automatically added to the Media library.

!!! note

    In the Media library, to avoid potential conflicts, 
    if several images are added with identical file names, 
    each of them is modified by appending a unique prefix.
