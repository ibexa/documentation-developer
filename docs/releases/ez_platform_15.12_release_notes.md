15.12 is the first stable release of eZ Platform. 

These release notes describe the first stable Fast-Track release of eZ Platform, as compared to the previous one, 15.11.

## Highlights

### The `ezpublish` folder has been renamed to `app`

The directory that contains the configuration, cache and kernel files had been named `ezpublish` since release 5.0. After serious consideration, it has been renamed to `app`, in order to be closer to the standard Symfony distribution.

### The default installation data have been cleaned up

Since the removal of the demo in the 2015.11 release, a clean SQL dump is now used to install the system. This dump has been cleaned up, and should now provide you with a very clean basis to start your projects. It contains a few content types (folder, article, image, user group, user), as well as the minimal folders (Content, Media, and Users).

It will be installed when executing `php app/console ezplatform:install clean`.

### Online editor improvements

A new feature made it into the Online Editor: image editing. While the feature is still a bit primitive, it will allow you to embed an image Content item into a richtext field ([EZP-25108](http://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-25108)).

In addition, several issues with the editor were fixed:

-   The "add content" toolbar will show up independently of the focus mode ([EZP-24829](https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-24829), [EZP-25182](https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-25182)), will disappear when the editor loses focus ([EZP-25181](https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-25181)), and will be rendered correctly in IE11/Edge ([EZP-25189](https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-25189))
-   html5edit input with HTML entities is now accepted ([EZP-24732](https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-24732))
-   Richtext content can now be published with Firefox ([EZP-25161](https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-25161))

### Enhanced PlatformUI performances with the combo loader

The assets used by PlatformUI will now be combined into a couple large files. This drastically reduces the amount of HTTP queries required to load the UI, resulting in a much shorter loading time.

### Universal discovery widget search interface

A search form has been added to the universal discovery widget. Combined with the tree based navigation, this makes locating content in the tree easier than before.

### REST API

The REST API views will now include the total number of search hits.
