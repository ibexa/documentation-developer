#### Deleting translations

You can now remove translations from Content item Versions through the PHP API.

You also have a new endpoint available for deleting a single Version, see [EZP-27864](https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-27864) for more information.

#### Improved Security for password storage

1.12 introduces and enables by default more secure user passwords hashing using bcrypt,
and is future-proofed for new hashing formats being added to PHP, like Argon2i coming with PHP 7.2.

This feature is added both in eZ Platform and the accompanying eZ Publish legacy 2017.10 release for projects looking to migrate to a newer version of Platform and take advantage of the new features.

#### Improved Varnish performance

This release switches default HTTPCache usage to use ezplatform-http-cache package, which uses Varnish xkey allowing: soft purge, better cache clearing logic and longer ttl.

For Varnish users be aware thus change implies new VCL and requriment for varnish-moduels package, see [below](#updating).

### Updating

To update to this version, follow the [Updating eZ Platform](../updating/updating_ez_platform.md) guide and use v1.12.0 as `<version>`.

!!! caution "BC: Change for Varnish users"

    This release enables the [ezplatform-http-cache](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-http-cache) Bundle by default as it has a more future-proof approach for HttpCache:
    - Cache tagging is more reliable at clearing all affected cache on, for instance, subtree operations
    - More performant using [xkey](https://github.com/varnish/varnish-modules/blob/master/docs/vmod_xkey.rst) _("Surrogate Key")_ and soft purging, over BAN and growing ban list

    This means:
    - There is a new VCL
    - Requires Varnish 4.1+ with `varnish-modules` _(incl. xkey)_, or Varnish Plus where it is built in

    Further reading in [doc/varnish/varnish.md](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/blob/v1.9.0/doc/varnish/varnish.md).

    #### How to still use the old VCL and the old X-Location-Id headers

    In all 1.x releases you will still be able to revert this and use the old deprecated system if you need to. To do that:
    - Keep using the VCL for BAN
    - Disable _(comment out)_ `EzSystemsPlatformHttpCacheBundle` in `app/AppKernel.php`
    - Change `app/AppCache.php` back to extend `eZ\Bundle\EzPublishCoreBundle\HttpCache`

    That's it, other changes added in 1.12 like increased cache ttl and `fos_http_cache` cache control rules for error pages should work also with BAN setup, and are thus optional.

!!! note "React"

    This release changes the way of loading React to avoid a case where it was loaded twice and caused errors.
    Take this into consideration if you user React in your own implementation.

    See [this PR](https://github.com/ezsystems/PlatformUIBundle/pull/906) for more information.
