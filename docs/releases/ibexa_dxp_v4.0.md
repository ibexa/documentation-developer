Lorem ipsum

### Separate recommendations for different websites

Personalization service has been enhanced to allow returning separate recommendations 
for different websites. 
This way you can eliminate irrelevant recommendations when you set up stores that 
operate on different markets or under different brands.

For more information, see [Support for multiple websites](https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/latest/personalization/use_cases/#hosting-multiple-websites).

## Other changes

### Draft locking

You can now configure and use the locking feature to lock a draft of a Content item, 
so that only an assigned person can edit it, and no other user can take it over. 

For more information, see the [developer](../guide/workflow.md#draft-locking) and the [user](https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/master/publishing/editorial_workflow/#draft-locking) documentation.

### Enhanced GraphQL location handling

### Migration API

You can now manage [data migrations](../guide/data_migration.md) by using the PHP API,
including getting migration information and running individual migration files.

See [Managing migrations](../api/public_php_api_managing_migrations.md) for more information.

## Deprecations
