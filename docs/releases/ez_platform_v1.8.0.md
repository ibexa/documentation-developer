Upgrade notes

This release contains special steps to follow further described in [Updating eZ Platform](../releases/updating_ez_platform.md).



## Notable Changes Since v1.7.0 LTS

### eZ Platform

#### User Interface

-   In Universal Discovery Widget (UDW) the browse view now uses a completely new browser widget, which replaces Treeview. This solves limitations on how many items you can browse for, and provides a more intuitive user experience.

-   Improvements in the Online Editor:
    -   You now have the ability to rearrange elements in the editor by moving them up and down.
    -   You can now add links to internal content items in the Online Editor, decide in which tab the link should open, and set link title:![](img/link-options-oe.png)
-   Improvements to the Sub-Items view of a Content Item: You can now sort content items by clicking column headings

-   The main titles of the ContentTypeView now expand and retract with an accordion function
-   Updated and added icons for the Admin Interface
-   The whole interface of PlatformUI is now translatable using Crowdin, including in-context translation where you can navigate the interface while translating. A glossary has been established to aid in unified usage of terminology throughout. [Contributions welcome](https://crowdin.com/project/ezplatform)!

#### Under the Hood

-   New opt-in approach to HttpCache to improve usability as well as performance by means of:
    -   Cache multi-tagging: allowing you to tag pages with a path, location, type, parent, etc. so the repository can clear cache in a more targeted, accurate, and flexible way, getting rid of any "clear all" situations on complex operations.
    -   For Varnish this uses [xkey](https://github.com/varnish/varnish-modules/blob/master/docs/vmod_xkey.rst) instead of BAN, enabling greater performance by allowing you to control grace time.
    -   This also places HttpCache in a separate repo, allowing it to grow independently: see <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-http-cache>
-   New `content/publish` policy to be able to configure `content/edit` rights independently from publish rights
-   Community-provided translations of the user interface may be imported individually to conserve resources
-   Replaced deprecated templating helper assets with assets packages service
-   Localization of handlebar templates
-   Also part of v1.7.1 from the end of January:
    -   Solr: Solving last issues in UI hindering relative ranking of search results from working properly
    -   API: Respect `defaultAlwaysAvailable` setting on `newContentCreateStruct` solving issues with for instance Kaliop Migrations bundle use
    -   Landing pages: Better support for wider range of multi-site setups
    -   Online Editor: Ability to change a paragraph to header and back
