# Requirements

This document covers all supported versions of the product.
To review the requirements, select the specific version of [[= product_name =]] you're interested in.

The following server requirements cover both running the software on-premise and on third-party PaaS providers.

!!! note "[[= product_name_cloud =]]"

    For running on [[[= product_name_cloud =]]](https://www.ibexa.co/products/ibexa-cloud), where recommended configuration and support is provided out of the box, see separate [[[= product_name_cloud =]] section](#ibexa-cloud-requirements-and-setup) for further reading on its requirements.

The minimal setup requires PHP, MySQL/MariaDB, Apache/Nginx, Node.js and `yarn`.
Recommendation for production setups is to use Varnish/Fastly, Redis/Memcached, NFS/EFS/S3 and Solr/Elasticsearch in a [clustered setup](clustering.md).

!!! caution "Recommended versions"

    Review all the recommended versions carefully.
    If you see a "+" next to the product version, it means that we recommend this version or higher within the same major release.
    For example, "1.18+" means any 1.x version higher or equal to 1.18, but not 2.x.

    Using the latest listed version of each product or component is recommended.
    Always use a version that receives security updates, either by the vendor themselves or by a trusted third party, such as the distribution vendor.

## [[= product_name_cloud =]] requirements and setup

=== "[[= product_name_cloud =]] v4.6"

    ### Cloud hosting with [[= product_name_cloud =]] and Platform.sh

    In general, [[= product_name_cloud =]] supports all features and services of [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/marketplace/ibexa/) that are compatible and supported by the [[= product_name =]] version you use.

    For example:

    - Platform.sh provides Redis support for versions 3.2, 4.0 and 5.0. [[= product_name =]] supports Redis version 4.0 or higher, and recommends 5.0.
    As a result, Redis is supported on [[= product_name_cloud =]] in versions 4.0 and 5.0, but 5.0 is recommended.

    Features or services supported by [[= product_name =]] but not covered by Platform.sh may be possible by means of a [custom integration](#custom-integrations).

    ### [[= product_name_cloud =]] Setup support matrix

    All [[= product_name =]] features are supported in accordance with the example above.
    For example: As Legacy Bridge isn't supported with v3, it's not supported on [[= product_name_cloud =]] either.

    !!! note

        As Platform.sh doesn't support a configuration with multiple PostgreSQL databases, for [[= product_name_cloud =]] / Platform.sh it's impossible to have a DFS table in a separate database.

    ### Recommended [[= product_name_cloud =]] setup

    For more details on recommended setup configuration see bundled `.platform.app.yaml` and `.platform/` configuration files.

    These files are kept up-to-date with latest recommendations and can be improved through contributions.

    ### Supported [[= product_name_cloud =]] setup

    Because of the large range of possible configurations of [[= product_name =]], there are many possibilities beyond what is provided in the default recommended configuration.

    Make sure to set aside time and budget for:

    - Verifying your requirements and ensuring they're supported by Platform.sh
    - Additional time for adaptation and configuration work, and testing by your development team
    - Additional consulting/onboarding time with Platform.sh, Ibexa technical services, and/or one of the many partners with prior experience in using Platform.sh with [[= product_name =]]

    The cost and effort of this isn't included in [[= product_name_cloud =]] subscription and is vary depending on the project.

    ### Custom integrations

    Features supported by [[= product_name =]], but not natively by Platform.sh, can in many cases be used by means of custom integrations with external services.

    For example, you can create an integration with S3 by means of setting up your own S3 bucket and configuring the relevant parts of [[= product_name =]].
    We recommend giving the development team working on the project access to the bucket to ensure work is done in a DevOps way without depending on external teams when changes are needed.

=== "[[= product_name_cloud =]] v3.3"

    ### Cloud hosting with [[= product_name_cloud =]] and Platform.sh

    In general, [[= product_name_cloud =]] supports all features and services of [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/marketplace/ibexa/) that are compatible and supported by the [[= product_name =]] version you use.

    For example:

    - Platform.sh provides Redis support for versions 3.2, 4.0 and 5.0. [[= product_name =]] supports Redis version 4.0 or higher, and recommends 5.0.
    As a result, Redis is supported on [[= product_name_cloud =]] in versions 4.0 and 5.0, but 5.0 is recommended.

    Features or services supported by [[= product_name =]] but not covered by Platform.sh may be possible by means of a [custom integration](#custom-integrations).

    ### [[= product_name_cloud =]] Setup support matrix

    !!! note

        As Platform.sh doesn't support a configuration with multiple PostgreSQL databases, for [[= product_name_cloud =]] / Platform.sh it's impossible to have a DFS table in a separate database.

    ### Recommended [[= product_name_cloud =]] setup

    For more details on recommended setup configuration see bundled `.platform.app.yaml` and `.platform/` configuration files.

    These files are kept up-to-date with latest recommendations and can be improved through contributions.
