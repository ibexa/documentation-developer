# Requirements

This document covers all supported versions of the product.
To review the requirements, select the specific version of Ibexa DXP you are interested in.

The following server requirements cover both running the software on-premise and on third-party PaaS providers.

!!! note "Ibexa Cloud"

    For running on [Ibexa Cloud](https://www.ibexa.co/products/ibexa-cloud), where recommended configuration and support is provided out of the box, see separate [Ibexa Cloud section](#ibexa-cloud-requirements-and-setup) for further reading on its requirements.

The minimal setup requires PHP, MySQL/MariaDB, Apache/Nginx, Node.js and `yarn`.
Recommendation for production setups is to use Varnish/Fastly, Redis/Memcached, NFS/EFS/S3 and Solr/Elasticsearch in a [clustered setup](clustering.md).

!!! caution "Recommended versions"

    Review all the recommended versions carefully. If you see a "+" next to the product version, it means that we recommend this version or higher within the same major release. For example, "1.18+" means any 1.x version higher or equal to 1.18, but not 2.x.

    Using the latest listed version of each product or component is recommended. Always use a version that receives security updates, either by the vendor themselves or by a trusted third party, such as the distribution vendor.

## Ibexa Cloud requirements and setup

=== "Ibexa Cloud v4.5 "

    ### Cloud hosting with Ibexa Cloud and Platform.sh

    In general, Ibexa Cloud supports all features and services of [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/marketplace/ibexa/) that are compatible and supported by the Ibexa DXP version you use.

    For example:

    - Platform.sh provides Redis support for versions 3.2, 4.0 and 5.0. Ibexa DXP supports Redis version 4.0 or higher, and recommends 5.0. As a result, Redis is supported on Ibexa Cloud in versions 4.0 and 5.0, but 5.0 is recommended.

    Features or services supported by Ibexa DXP but not covered by Platform.sh may be possible by means of a [custom integration](#custom-integrations).

    ### Ibexa Cloud Setup support matrix

    All Ibexa DXP features are supported in accordance with the example above. For example: As Legacy Bridge is not supported with v3, it is not supported on Ibexa Cloud either.

    !!! note

        As Platform.sh does not support a configuration with multiple PostgreSQL databases,
        for Ibexa Cloud / Platform.sh it is impossible to have a DFS table in a separate database.

    ### Recommended Ibexa Cloud setup

    For more details on recommended setup configuration see bundled `.platform.app.yaml` and `.platform/` configuration files.

    These files are kept up-to-date with latest recommendations and can be improved through contributions.

    ### Supported Ibexa Cloud setup

    Because of the large range of possible configurations of Ibexa DXP, there are many possibilities beyond what is provided in the default recommended configuration.

    Make sure to set aside time and budget for:

    - Verifying your requirements and ensuring they are supported by Platform.sh
    - Additional time for adaptation and configuration work, and testing by your development team
    - Additional consulting/onboarding time with Platform.sh, Ibexa technical services, and/or one of the many partners with prior experience using Platform.sh with Ibexa DXP

    The cost and effort of this is not included in Ibexa Cloud subscription and will vary depending on the project.

    ### Custom integrations

    Features supported by Ibexa DXP, but not natively by Platform.sh, can in many cases be used by means of custom integrations with external services.

    For example, you can create an integration with S3 by means of setting up your own S3 bucket and configuring the relevant parts of Ibexa DXP.
    We recommend giving the development team working on the project access to the bucket
    to ensure work is done in a DevOps way without depending on external teams when changes are needed.

=== "Ibexa Cloud v3.3 "

    ### Cloud hosting with Ibexa Cloud and Platform.sh

    In general, Ibexa Cloud supports all features and services of [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/marketplace/ibexa/) that are compatible and supported by the Ibexa DXP version you use.

    For example:

    - Platform.sh provides Redis support for versions 3.2, 4.0 and 5.0. Ibexa DXP supports Redis version 4.0 or higher, and recommends 5.0. As a result, Redis is supported on Ibexa Cloud in versions 4.0 and 5.0, but 5.0 is recommended.

    Features or services supported by Ibexa DXP but not covered by Platform.sh may be possible by means of a [custom integration](#custom-integrations).

    ### Ibexa Cloud Setup support matrix

    All Ibexa DXP features are supported in accordance with the example above. For example: As Legacy Bridge is not supported with v3, it is not supported on Ibexa Cloud either.

    to ensure work is done in a DevOps way without depending on external teams when changes are needed.

=== "eZ Platform Cloud v2.5 "

    ### Cloud hosting with eZ Platform Cloud and Platform.sh

    In general, eZ Platform Cloud supports all features and services of [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/hosting/php/ez) that are compatible and supported by the eZ Platform version you use.

    For example:

    - Platform.sh provides Redis support for versions 2.8, 3.0 and 3.2. eZ Platform supports Redis version 3.2 or higher. As a result, Redis is supported by eZ Platform Cloud versions 3.2.
    - Platform.sh provides Elastic Search service (different versions supported). Elastic Search is not supported for use as search engine for eZ Platform.

    Features or services supported by eZ Platform but not covered by Platform.sh may be possible by means of a [custom integration](#custom-integrations).

    ### Recommended eZ Platform Cloud setup

    For more details on recommended setup configuration see bundled `.platform.app.yaml` and `.platform/` configuration files.

    These files are kept up-to-date with latest recommendations and can be improved through contributions.

    ### Supported eZ Platform Cloud setup

    Because of the large range of possible configurations of eZ Publish legacy, there is no ready-made recommended setup.
    Make sure to set aside time and budget for:

    - Verifying your legacy configuration and ensuring it is supported by Platform.sh
    - Additional time for adaptation and configuration work, and testing by your own team
    - Additional consulting/onboarding time with Platform.sh, Ibexa technical services, and/or one of the many partners with prior experience using Platform.sh with eZ Publish legacy

    The cost and effort of this is not included in eZ Platform Cloud subscription and will vary depending on the project.

    ### Experimental/custom Platform.sh setups

    Any use of experimental versions or setups is not eligible for use with eZ Platform Cloud.
    However, it is possible to use an eZ Enterprise subscription in combination with a Platform.sh contract,
    where you or a partner take ownership of the configuration to set up the project.

    Such projects are possible by means of custom integrations/configuration,
    but they may generate issues that won't be covered by eZ Enterprise subscription bug fix guarantee.

    !!! tip "Use a partner with prior experience on legacy and Platform.sh"

        If you are in need of setting up your legacy project on Platform.sh for a transitional period,
        eZ can put you in contact with a partner experienced in setting up older projects on Platform.sh.
        This will save you a lot of time and effort.
        
    !!! note

        As Platform.sh does not support a configuration with multiple PostgreSQL databases,
        for eZ Platform Cloud / Platform.sh it is impossible to have a DFS table in a separate database.

    ### Custom integrations

    Features supported by eZ Platform, but not natively by Platform.sh, can in many cases be used by means of custom integrations with external services.

    For example, you can create an integration with S3 by means of setting up your own S3 bucket and configuring the relevant parts of eZ Platform.
    We recommend giving the development team working on the project access to the bucket
    to ensure work is done in a DevOps way without depending on external teams when changes are needed.
