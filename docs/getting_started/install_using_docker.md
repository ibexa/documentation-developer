# Installation using Docker

## eZ Launchpad for quick deployment

If you want to get your eZ Platform installation up and running quickly,
we recommend Docker-based [eZ Launchpad](https://ezsystems.github.io/launchpad/)
which takes care of the whole setup for you.

## Docker blueprints for advance/custom use

> Docker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies
into a standardized unit for software development. â€“ Docker.com

!!! caution

    If you have more custom needs, you can find some examples of Docker usage with eZ Platform in
    [doc/docker/README.md](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/blob/master/doc/docker/README.md).

    However, the Docker tools inside the repository are currently intended for internal use: automation, support, QA,
    engineering and demos, and for advanced users to contribute on as a blueprint for Docker, Docker swarm, Kubernetes, etc.
