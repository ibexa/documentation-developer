# Install [[= product_name =]] on macOS or Windows

This page explains how to install [[= product_name =]] on macOS or Windows.

!!! caution

    This procedure is **for development purposes only**.
    Installing [[= product_name =]] for production purposes is supported only on Linux.

    For information about installing the product on Linux, see [Installing [[= product_name =]]](../getting_started/install_ez_platform.md).  

### Prepare work environment

To install [[= product_name =]], you need a stack with MySQL and PHP.
Additionally, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) for asset management.
If you want to use a web server, you need to install it as well:

- For Windows: Apache
- For macOS: Apache/nginx

The instructions below assume that you are using Apache.

??? "Windows"

    Locate the `php.ini` file and open it in a text editor.
    Provide the missing values to relevant parameters, for example, `date.timezone` and `memory_limit`:

    ``` bash
    date.timezone = "Europe/Warsaw"
    memory_limit = 4G
    ```

    Uncomment or add extensions relevant to your project, for example, `opcache` extension for PHP (recommended, not required):

    ``` bash
    zend_extension=opcache.so
    ```
    
    You can install Apache as a Windows service by running the following command in CMD as administrator:

    ``` bash
    httpd.exe -k -install
    ```

    You can then start it with:

    ``` bash
    httpd.exe -k start
    ```

    Edit Apache configuration file `httpd.conf`.
    Replace placeholder values with corresponding values from your project, for example, `ServerName localhost:80`.
    Uncomment relevant modules, for example:

    ``` bash
    LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
    LoadModule vhost_alias_module libexec/apache2/mod_vhost_alias.so
    ```

## Get Composer

=== "macOS"

    Install Composer using a package manager, for example, [Homebrew.](https://brew.sh/)

=== "Windows"

    Download and run [Composer-Setup.exe](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe) - it will install the latest Composer version.

## Install [[= product_name =]]

At this point the installation procedure is the same as when installing on Linux.
Follow the steps from the main [Installing [[= product_name =]]](../getting_started/install_ez_platform.md#install-ibexa-dxp) page.

## Set up virtual host

Prepare a [virtual host configuration](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/) for your site in your Apache directory:

- For Windows: `<Apache>\conf\vhosts`
- For macOS: `/private/etc/apache2/users/`

Then restart the Apache server.

## Set up permissions

Directories `var` and `web/var` need to be writable by CLI and web server user.
Future files and directories created by these two users will need to inherit those permissions.

!!! note "Security checklist"

    See the [Security checklist](../guide/security_checklist.md) for a list of security-related issues
    that you should take care of before going live with a project.
