# Bundles starter pack

eZ Platform follows the [Symfony 5 bundle system](http://symfony.com/doc/5.0/book/bundles.html).
Clean installation comes with set of built-in packages which you can preview in [composer.json](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/blob/v3.0.0/composer.json).

For more information about eZ Platform bundle structure, see [Bundle section](../guide/bundles.md) in our Guide.

## External packages

If basic bundles do not give you enough flexibility or functionalities, you can extend your project with external packages.
They provide additional ways of customizing your installation, and can help you with content management, further development, integrations, security, social engagement, and system management.

You can easily browse the external bundles and download them from [eZ Platform Packages](https://ezplatform.com/packages).
Refer to their respective pages for instructions on how to install them.
