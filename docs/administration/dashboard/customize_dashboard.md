You can customize the dashboard depending on your needs using Dahboard Builder.
Customized dashboard displays a set of widgets selected by the user.

!!! tip

     Detailed instruction on how to customize dashboard using Dashboard Builder is available in [[[= product_name =]] user documentation](https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/latest/getting_started/dashboard/work_with_dashboard/#customize-dashboard).

## Manage permissions

To customize dashboard, you need to have `dashboard/cutomize` [policy](permission_overview.md).

By default, all the users belonging to the `Editors` User Group, have `Dashboard`[Role](roles_admin_panel.md) assigned, so they can edit, create, or delete dashboard.
If, by any reason, you want to narrow this permission, you can set up specific [limitations](limitations.md).

## Add custom layout

For new dashboard you need to choose layout which defines the available zones.
While opening Dashboard Builder, layout window appears - you can choose one from available layouts.

You can also add custom layout that then can be available in Dashboard Builder.

For more information, see [Customize storefront layout](customize_storefront_layout.md).

## Create custom blocks

Dashboard builder provides set of ready-to-use blocks, for example, Common content, Quick actions, or [[= product_name =]] News.

For more information about available blocks, see [[[= product_name =]] user documentation](https://doc.ibexa.co/projects/userguide/en/latest/getting_started/dashboard/dashboard_block_reference/).

In addition to existing blocks available in Dashboard Builder, you can also create custom blocks.
