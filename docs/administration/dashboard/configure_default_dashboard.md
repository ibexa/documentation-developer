# Configure default dashboard

You can configure default dashboard under the `ibexa.system.<scope>.admin_group` [configuration key](configuration.md#configuration-files).

Create `ibexa_dashboard.yaml` file in the `config/packages/` directory.
The following example configuration defines default dashboard:

``` yaml
ibexa:
    system:
        admin_group:
            dashboard:
                container_remote_id: dashboard_container
                default_dashboard_remote_id: default_dashboard
                users_container_remote_id: user_dashboards
                predefined_container_remote_id: predefined_dashboards
                section_identifier: dashboard
                content_type_identifier: dashboard_landing_page
                container_content_type_identifier: folder
```

Configuration can be set per [SiteAccess](multisite_configuration.md#siteaccess-configuration)
or [SiteAccess group](multisite_configuration.md#siteaccess-groups).

All the settings in the configuration are reflected in the Back Office.

## Container content type identifier

Determines the content type identifier of the container for dashboards and lets you create additional structure for the predefined dashboards.
By default all the dashboards containers are set as a folders.

If the `folder` content type doesn't exist or is modified, you can use another one, for example:

```yaml
ibexa:
    system:
        default:
            dashboard:
                container_content_type_identifier: user_dashboard_container
```

The custom content type should be a container and needs to have a field type with `name` identifier.
