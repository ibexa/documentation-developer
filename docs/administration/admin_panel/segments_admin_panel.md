# Segments

You can use Segments to display specific content to specific Users.
They are used out of the box in the Targeting and Dynamic targeting blocks in the Page.

Segments are collected in Segment Groups:

Each Segment Group can contain Segments that you can target content for.

You can assign Users to Segments [through the API](segment_api.md#assigning-users).
