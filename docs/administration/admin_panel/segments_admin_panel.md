# Segments

You can use Segments to display specific content to specific [Users](users.md).
They are used out of the box in the Targeting and Dynamic targeting blocks in the Page.

Segments are collected in Segment Groups:

Each Segment Group can contain Segments that you can target content for.

You can assign Users to Segments [through the API](segment_api.md#assigning-users).
