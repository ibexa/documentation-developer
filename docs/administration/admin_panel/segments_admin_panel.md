# Segments

You can use segments to display specific content to specific [users](users.md).
They're used out of the box in the Targeting and Dynamic targeting blocks in the page.

You can collect segments in segment groups:

Each segment group can contain segments that you can target content for.

You can assign users to segments [through the API](segment_api.md#assigning-users).
