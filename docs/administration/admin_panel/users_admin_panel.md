# Users

[Users](users.md) in [[= product_name =]] are treated the same way as content items.
They are organized in groups such as *Guests*, *Editors*, *Anonymous*,
which makes it easier to manage them and their permissions.
All user groups and users can be accessed in the Admin panel by selecting **Users**.
