# Users

[Users](users.md) in [[= product_name =]] are treated the same way as content items.
They're organized in groups such as *Guests*, *Editors*, *Anonymous*, which makes it easier to manage them and their permissions.
You can access all users and user groups in the **Admin** panel by selecting **Users**.
