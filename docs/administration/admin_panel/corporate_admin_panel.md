# Corporate

You can manage companies profiles in the Admin Panel.

There, in the **Corporate** section, you can find basic information about existing companies, 
for example, details, versions, locations, translations, a list of members, billing addresses 
and technical details regarding the organization, such as visibility, IDs, or relations.
