## Object States

Object states are user-defined states that can be assigned to Content items.
They are contained in groups.

If a state group contains any states, each Content item is automatically assigned a state from this group.

You can assign states to content in the Back Office in the Content item's Details tab.

By default, [[= product_name =]] contains one Object state group: **Lock**, with states **Locked** and **Not locked**.

Object states can be used in conjunction with [permissions](permission_overview.md), in particular with the [Object State Limitation](limitation_reference.md#object-state-limitation).
Their specific use cases depend on your needs and the setup of your permission system.
