## Content Types

A Content Type is a base for new Content items.
It defines what Fields will be available in the Content item.

For example, a new Content Type called *Article* can have Fields such as title, author, body, image, etc.
Based on this Content Type, you can create any number of Content items.
Content Types are organized into groups.

You can add your own groups here to keep your Content Types in better order.
