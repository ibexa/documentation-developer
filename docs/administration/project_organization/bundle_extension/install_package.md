# Install bundle
 
## Add repository to composer


To be able to install the bundle in your [[= product_name_base =]] project, add the repository to the `composer.json`:

```json hl_lines="17"
    "repositories": {
        "ibexa": {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "https://updates.ibexa.co"
        },
        "acme/currency-exchange-rate":{
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "file:///Users/justyna.koralewicz/example-3rd-party-extension"
        }
    }
```

## Install bundle into application

On your [[= product_name_base =]] project root run:
 
```bash
composer require acme/currency-exchange-rate:dev-main
```

!!! note

    If your application uses Symfony Flex, the bundle is registered automatically after you install it.
Check whether the bundle is enabled, if not, you must enable it per environment in the `config/bundles.php` file:

```php
return [
    Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\FrameworkBundle::class => ['all' => true],
    ...
    Ibexa\Bundle\TestFixtures\IbexaTestFixturesBundle::class => ['all' => true],
    ACME\Bundle\CurrencyExchangeRate\ACMECurrencyExchangeRateBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];
```
Next, clear the cache by runnig the following command:

```bash
php bin/console cache:clear
```

The newly installed bundle should be visible in the **Composer** tab in **Admin** -> **System information**.
