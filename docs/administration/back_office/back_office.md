# Back office

The back office interface is produced by the [`ibexa/admin-ui` bundle](https://github.com/ibexa/admin-ui).
Additionally, it uses React-based modules that make each part of the UI extensible, and Bootstrap for styling.
The interface is accessible in your browser at `http://<yourdomain>/admin`.

To extend the back office with PHP code, you can use [events]([[= symfony_doc =]]/event_dispatcher.html), either built-in Symfony events or events dispatched by the application.

Some extensibility, such as [adding custom tags](extend_online_editor.md#configure-custom-tags), is possible without writing your own code, with configuration and templating only.

!!! note "String translations"

    Refer to [Custom string translations](back_office_translations.md#custom-string-translations) to learn how to provide string translations when extending the back office.
