## PHP API

The `ActivityLogService` PHP API can be used to browse activity logs and write new entries.

### Searching in the Activity Log entries

You can search among the activity log entries using `ActivityLogService::find` by passing an `Ibexa\Contracts\ActivityLog\Values\ActivityLog\Query`.
This `Query`'s constructor has four arguments:

1. `$criteria`: an array of criterion from `Ibexa\Contracts\ActivityLog\Values\ActivityLog\Criterion` related as a logical AND.
2. `$sortClauses`: an array of `Ibexa\Contracts\ActivityLog\Values\ActivityLog\SortClause`.
3. `$offset`: a zero-based index integer indicating at which entry to start, its default value is `0` (zero, nothing skipped).
4. `$limit`: an integer as the maximum returned entry count, default is 25.

```php
[[= include_file('code_samples/recent_activity/MonitorRecentContentCreationCommand.php') =]]
```

See [Activity Log Search Criteria reference](activity_log_search.md) to discover query possibilities.

### Adding custom Activity Log entries

Your custom features could write into the activity log.

First, inject `Ibexa\Contracts\ActivityLog\ActivityLogServiceInterface` into your custom event subscriber, event listener, service, controller or whatever PHP class that will have to log an activity.

In the following example, an event subscriber is subscribing to an event dispatched by a custom feature. 

```php
[[= include_file('code_samples/recent_activity/MyFeatureEventSubscriber.php') =]]
```

`ActivityLogService::build` function returns an `Ibexa\Contracts\ActivityLog\Values\CreateActivityLogStruct` which can then be passed to `ActivityLogService::save`.

ActivityLogService::build has three arguments:

* `$className` is the PHP class name of the object actually manipulated by the feature. For example `Ibexa\Contracts\Core\Repository\Values\Content\Content::class`
* `$id` is the ID or identifier of the manipulated object. For example, the Content ID.
* `$action` is the identifier of the performed object manipulation. For example, `create`, `update` or `delete`.

The returned `CreateActivityLogStruct` is, by default, related to the currently logged-in user.

## REST API

REST API can be used to browse activity logs, see in the [REST API reference](../../api/rest_api/rest_api_reference/rest_api_reference.html#monitoring-activity-log).
