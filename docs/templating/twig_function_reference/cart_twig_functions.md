# Cart Twig functions

You can use cart Twig functions to check whether products can be added to cart, or to format the price value.

### `ibexa_can_be_added_to_cart()`

The `ibexa_can_be_added_to_cart()` function checks whether the provided product can be added to cart.
It eliminates products that aren't available, products that don't have a price that corresponds to a currency selected for the cart, and products, for which VAT category isn't set.
It also eliminates products that have variants but aren't one of those variants.

``` html+twig
{% set is_disabled = (is_disabled or ibexa_can_be_added_to_cart(product) == false)|default(false) %}
```
