    ## Override email template  
    
    Email is one of the Submit button options you can choose from in the Form Builder Interface.
    It allows you to list email addresses where notifications about newly filled forms should be sent to.

    To customize Form Builder submission notification you need to override Twig template `form_builder/form_submit_notification_email.html.twig`.
    It is built with two blocks, subject and body. Each of them is rendered independently and consists of three sets of parameters.
    
    |Parameter|Type|Description|
    |---------|----|-----------|
    |`content`|`eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\Content\Content`|Name of the form, its Content Type|
    |`form`|`EzSystems\EzPlatformFormBuilder\FieldType\Model\Form`|Definition of the form|
    |`data`|`EzSystems\EzPlatformFormBuilder\FieldType\Model\FormSubmission`|Sent data|  
    
    By adjusting them to your needs, you will change your email template.
    
    ## Configure sender details
    
    To send emails you also need to remember to configure `sender_address` in `app/config/config.yml`.
    It acts as a sender address and a return address where all bounced messages will be returned to.
