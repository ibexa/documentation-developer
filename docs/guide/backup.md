# Backup 

You should always make sure that your solution is properly backed up. The following example shows you how to do this on a Linux-UNIX-based system where eZ Platform is using a MySQL database called "example". You should shut down Platform if it's running before making a backup or an upgrade.

!!! note "Externally stored assets"

    If you store assets in any external service or localization, you should back them up before proceeding.

1\. Navigate into the eZ Platform directory:
 
```
cd /path/to/ezplatform
```
 
2\. Clear all caches:

```
var/cache/*
var/logs/*
```

3\. Create a dump of the database:
 
```
# MySQL
mysqldump -u <database_user> --add-drop-table <database_name> > db_backup.sql

# PostgreSQL
pg_dump -c --if-exists <database_name> > db_backup.sql
```

4\. In parent directory create a tar archive of the files (including the DB dump) using the "tar" command:

```
tar cfz backup_of_ezplatform.tar.gz ezplatform
```

At this point, the file `backup_of_ezplatform.tar.gz` should contain a backup of DB and files.
