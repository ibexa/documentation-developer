# Bestsellers

Bestsellers are determined based on all confirmed orders. The information how often a product was purchased is stored in Solr by a Solr plugin.
The shop owner can specify from which point a product counts as a bestseller.

Bestsellers can be displayed on Landing Pages, category pages and a bestseller page. 

## Configuration

To enable bestsellers, set the following parameter to true:

``` yaml
siso_core.default.enable_bestsellers: true
```

The following settings are available in the eCommerce->Configuration Settings->Miscellaneous section in the Back Office:

| Configuration        | Description      |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Number of bestsellers displayed on bestseller page | |
| Number of bestsellers displayed on catalog pages   | |
| Number of bestsellers displayed in a slider        | How many bestsellers should be available in a slider on a Landing Page      |
| Threshold   | How often a product has to be sold to count as a bestseller  |
