# Shop templates [[% include 'snippets/commerce_badge.md' %]]

[[= product_name_com =]] offers additional Twig functions and filters you can use in templates.

## Template resolver

[[= product_name_com =]] comes with a [template resolver](template_resolver.md) system which enables overriding templates on a SiteAccess and design base. 

## Design engine

Instead of the template resolver you can use the [design engine](../design_engine.md).
See [Integration of the design engine](design_engine.md) for more information.

## Shop templates

Built-in templates for the shop are stored in multiple bundles
