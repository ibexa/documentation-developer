# Permissions

## Permission overview

A User by default does not have access to anything. To get access they need to inherit Roles, typically assigned to the User Group they belong to.

Each Role can contain one or more **Policies**. A Policy is a rule that gives access to a single **function** in a **module**.
For example, a `section/assign` Policy allows the User to assign content to Sections.

When you add a Policy to a Role, you can also restrict it using one or more **Limitations**.
A Policy with a Limitation will only apply when the condition in the Limitation is fulfilled.
For example, a `content/publish` Policy with a `ContentType` Limitation on the "Blog Post" Content Type will allow the User to publish only Blog Posts, and not other Content.

Note that Policies on one Role are connected with the *and* relation, not *or*,
so when Policy has more than one Limitation, all of them have to apply. See [example below](#restrict-editing-to-part-of-the-tree).

Remember that a Limitation specifies what a User *can* do, not what they *can't do*.
A `Section` Limitation, for example, *gives* the User access to the selected Section, not *prohibits* it.

See [Available Limitations](limitations.md#available-limitations) for further information.

To take effect, a Role must be assigned to a User or User Group. Every User or User Group can have many roles. A User can also belong to many groups, for example, Administrators, Editors, Subscribers.

Best practice is to avoid assigning Roles to Users directly; instead, make sure you model your content (types, structure, sections, etc.) in a way that can be reflected in generic roles. Besides being much easier to manage and keep on top of security-wise, this also makes sure your system performs best. The more Role assignments and complex Policies you add for a given User, the more complex the search/load queries powering the whole CMS will be, as they always take permissions into account.

## Use Cases

Here are a few examples of sets of Policies you can use to get some common permission configurations.

#### Enter back end interface

To allow the User to enter the back end interface and view all Content, you need to set the following Policies:

- `user/login`
- `content/read`
- `content/versionread`
- `section/view`
- `content/reverserelatedlist`

These Policies will be necessary for all other cases below that require access to the PlatformUI.

#### Create and publish content

To create and publish content, the user must additionally have the following Policies:

- `content/create`
- `content/edit`
- `content/publish`

This also lets the user copy and move content, as well as add new Locations to a Content item (but not remove them!).

#### Create content without publishing

This option can be used together with eZ Enterprise's content review options. Using the following Policies, the User is able to create content, but can't publish it; instead, they must send it for review to another User with proper permissions (for example, senior editor, proofreader, etc.).

- `content/create`
- `content/edit`

Note that without eZ Enterprise this setup should not be used, as it will not allow the User to continue working with their content.

#### Restrict editing to part of the tree

If you want to let the User create or edit Content, but only in one part of the content tree, you need to use Limitations. Three Limitations that could be used here are `Section` Limitation, `Node` Limitation and `Subtree` Limitation.

Let's assume you have two Folders under your Home: Blog and Articles. You can let a User create Content for the blogs, but not in Articles by adding a `Subtree` Limitation on the Blog Content item. This will allow the User to publish content anywhere under this Location in the structure.

A `Section` Limitation can be used similarly, but a Section does not have to belong to the same subtree in the content structure, any Locations can be assigned to it.

If you add a `Node` Limitation and point to the same Location, the User will be able to publish content directly under the selected Location, but not anywhere deeper in its subtree.

Note that when a Policy has more than one Limitation, all of them have to apply, or the Policy will not work. For example, a `Location` Limitation on Location `1/2` and `Subtree` Limitation on `1/2/55` cannot work together, because no Location can satisfy both those requirements at the same time. If you want to combine more than one Limitation with the *or* relation, not *and*, you can split your Policy in two, each with one of these Limitations.

#### Multi-file upload

Creating content through multi-file upload is treated in the same way as regular creation.
To enable upload, you need you set the following permissions:

- `content/create`
- `content/read`
- `content/publish`

You can control what Content items can be uploaded and where using Limitations on the `content/create` and `content/publish` Policies.

A Node Limitation limits uploading to a specific Location in the tree. A Class Limitation controls the Content Types that are allowed.
For example, you can set the Node Limitation on a "Pictures" Folder, and add a Class Limitation
which only allows Content items of type "Image". This ensures that only files of type "image" can be uploaded,
and only to the "Pictures" Folder.

#### Manage Locations

To add a new Location to a Content item, the Policies required for publishing content are enough. To allow the User to remove a Location, you need to grant them the following Policies:

- `content/remove`
- `content/manage_locations`

Hiding and revealing Location requires one more Policy: `content/hide`.

#### Removing content

To send content to trash, the User needs to have the same two Policies that are required for removing Locations:

- `content/remove`
- `content/manage_locations`

To remove an archived version of content, the User must have the `content/versionremove` Policy.

Further manipulation of trash requires the `content/restore` Policy to restore items from trash, and `content/cleantrash` to completely delete all content from the trash.

#### Registering Users

To allow anonymous users to register through the `/register` route, you need to grant the `user/register` Policy to the Anonymous User Group.
