## Additional lines

A response that ERP sends to the shop can contain more information about a product than was requested.
This information can include additional shipping costs, vouchers, bonus products, discounts, etc.
This information is handled by a service that adds lines to the basket or to a basket line.

`WebConnectorService` passes the whole ERP response object to [`RemotePriceProvider`](remotepriceprovider.md).
`RemotePriceProvider` creates additional lines in the price response if it gets additional price information from ERP that has not been requested.
