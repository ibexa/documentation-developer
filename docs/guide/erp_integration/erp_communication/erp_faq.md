## Cannot determine message object

If you see an exception "The message object could not be determined",
the YAML file with the message may be missing.

When a message is generated, a new YAML file is created.
The YAML file has to be included. Usually all YAML files generated by the ERP command-line script are defined in `parameters.yml` in your bundle.
This file has to be loaded e.g. in `app/config/config.yml`.
