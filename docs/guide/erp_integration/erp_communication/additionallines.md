# Additional lines

A response sent to the shop from ERP can contain more information about product than was requested.
This additional information can include additional shipping costs, vouchers, another product for free, promotions, etc.
This information is handled by the service which adds the proper lines to basket or basket line.

Additional lines in the basket are stored as `$additionalLines[]`.
Additional lines in a basket line are stored as `$assignedLines[]`.

## WebConnectorService

`WebConnectorService` passes the whole ERP response object to the [RemotePriceProvider](../remotepriceprovider.md).
`RemotePriceProvider` creates additional lines in the price response, if it gets additional price information from ERP that has not been requested.

## AdditionalLine

`AdditionalLine` defines the class for additional lines that can be related to the basket or basket line.
Additional lines can increase or decrease the order sum.

            {
                'outputPrice': {'property': 'priceInclVat', 'raw' : true}
