## Using PostgreSQL

eZ Platform uses MySQL by default, but you can also choose to install it with PostgreSQL.

### Requirements

To use PostgreSQL, you need to have the `pdo_pgsql` PHP extension installed.

Make sure you have the `ezsystems/doctrine-dbal-schema` Composer package installed
and `EzSystems\DoctrineSchemaBundle\DoctrineSchemaBundle()` enabled.
If not, install the package with `composer require ezsystems/doctrine-dbal-schema`
and enable `DoctrineSchemaBundle` in `AppKernel.php`.

### Provide parameters

When you run `composer install`, you will be asked to [provide installation parameters](../getting_started/install_ez_platform.md#provide-installation-parameters).

If you use PostgreSQL, two parameters need to be set differently than when using MySQL:

- `env(DATABASE_DRIVER)` must be set to `pdo_pgsql` instead of the default `pdo_mysql`
- `env(DATABASE_CHARSET)` must be set to `utf8`, because the default value of `utf8mb4` is MySQL-specific.

The rest of the installation procedure is the same as when using MySQL.
