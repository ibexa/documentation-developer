# Persistence cache

![SPI cache diagram](img/spi_cache.png)

## Layers

Persistence cache can best be described as an implementation of `SPI\Persistence` that decorates the main backend implementation, aka Storage Engine *(currently: "Legacy Storage Engine")*.

As shown in the illustration, this is done in the exact same way as the SignalSlot feature is a custom implementation of `API\Repository` decorating the main Repository. In the case of Persistence Cache, instead of sending events on calls passed on to the decorated implementation, most of the load calls are cached, and calls that perform changes purge the affected caches. Cache handlers *(Memcached, Redis, Filesystem, etc.)* can configured using Symfony configuration. For how to reuse this Cache service in your own custom code, see below.

## Transparent cache

With the persistence cache, just like with the HTTP cache, eZ Platform tries to follow principles of "Transparent caching".
This can shortly be described as a cache which is invisible to the end user (admin/editors) of eZ Platform where content
is always returned "fresh". In other words, there should be no need to manually clear the cache like it was frequently
the case with eZ Publish 4.x. This is possible thanks to an interface that follows CRUD (Create Read Update Delete)
operations per domain.

## What is cached?

Persistence cache aims at caching most `SPI\Persistence` calls used in common page loads, including everything needed for permission checking and URL alias lookups.

Notes:

- `UrlWildCardHandler` is not currently cached
- Currently in case of transactions this is handled by clearing all cache on rollback, so avoid using rollbacks
  as part of your normal application logic flow. For instance if you connect to third party service and it frequently
  fails make sure to re-try several times, and if that does not help, consider making the logic async by design.
- [Cache tagging](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/cache/cache_invalidation.html#using-cache-tags) is used in
  order to allow clearing cache by alternative indexes, for instance tree operations or changes to content types are
  examples of operations that also need to invalidate content cache by tags.
- Search is not defined as persistence and the queries themselves are not planned to be cached as they are too complex by design (full text, facets, etc.).
  Use [Solr](solr.md) which caches this for you to improve scale, and to offload your database.

## Persistence cache configuration

!!! note

    Current implementation uses Symfony cache. It technically supports the following cache backends:
    [APCu, Array, Chain, Doctrine, Filesystem, Memcached, PDO & Doctrine DBAL, Php Array, Proxy, Redis](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/cache/cache_pools.html#creating-cache-pools).
    We recommend using Redis for clustering and Filesystem for single server.

*Use of Memcached or Redis is a requirement for use in Clustering setup. For an overview of this feature, see [Clustering](clustering.md).*

!!! note

    When eZ Platform changes to another PSR-6 based cache system in the future, then configuration documented below will change.

**Cache service**

The cache system is exposed as a "cache" service, and can be reused by any other service as described in the [Using Cache service](repository.md#using-cache-service) section.

### Configuration

By default, configuration currently uses **FileSystem** to store cache files, which is defined in [`default_parameters.yml`](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/blob/2.0/app/config/default_parameters.yml#L22).
You can select a different cache backend and configure it's parameters in the relevant file in the `cache_pool` folder.

#### Multi Repository setup

In `ezplatform.yml` you can specify which cache pool you want to use on a SiteAccess or SiteAccess group level. The following example shows use in a SiteAccess group:

``` yaml
# ezplatform.yml site group setting
ezpublish:
    system:
        # "site_group" refers to the group configured in site access
        site_group:
            # cache_pool is set to '%env(CACHE_POOL)%'
            # env(CACHE_POOL) is set to 'cache.app' (a Symfony service), for more examples see app/config/cache_pool/*
            cache_service_name: '%cache_pool%'
```

!!! note "One cache pool for each Repository"

    If your installation has several Repositories *(databases)*, make sure every group of sites using different Repositories also uses a different cache pool.

### Redis

[Redis](http://redis.io/), an in-memory data structure store, is the recommended cache solution for clustering.
Redis is used via [Redis pecl extension](https://pecl.php.net/package/redis).

See [Redis Cache Adapter in Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/3.4/components/cache/adapters/redis_adapter.html#configure-the-connection)
for information on how to configure Redis.

Example:

``` yaml
services:
    cache.redis:
        parent: cache.adapter.redis
        tags:
            - name: cache.pool
              clearer: cache.app_clearer
              provider: 'redis://secret@example.com:1234/13'
```

!!! caution "Clearing Redis cache"

    The regular `php bin/console cache:clear` command does not clear Redis persistence cache.
    To clear it, use a dedicated Symfony command: `php bin/console cache:pool:clear cache.redis`.

##### Redis Clustering

Persistence cache depends on all involved web servers, each of them seeing the same view of the cache because it's shared among them.
With that in mind, the following configurations of Redis are possible:

- [Redis Cluster](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial)
    - Shards cache across several instances in order to be able to cache more than memory of one server allows
    - Shard slaves can improve availability, however [they use asynchronous replication](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial#redis-cluster-consistency-guarantees) so they can't be used for reads
    - Unsupported Redis features that can affect performance: [pipelining](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis/blob/develop/cluster.markdown#pipelining) and [most multiple key commands](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis/blob/develop/cluster.markdown#multiple-key-commands)
- [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel)
    - Provides high availability by providing one or several slaves (ideally 2 slaves or more, e.g. minimum 3 servers), and handle failover
    - [Slaves are asynchronously replicated](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel#fundamental-things-to-know-about-sentinel-before-deploying), so they can't be used for reads
    - Typically used with a load balancer (e.g. HAproxy) in the front in order to only speak to elected master
        - An alternative is that application logic itself speaks to Sentinel in order to always ask for elected master before talking to cache.

For best performance we recommend use of Redis Sentinel if it fits your needs. However different cloud providers have managed services that are easier to set up, and might perform better. Notable Services:

- [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/)
- [Azure Redis Cache](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cache/)
- [Google Cloud Memorystore](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/)

###### eZ Platform Cloud / Platform.sh usage

If you use Platform.sh Enterprise you can benefit from the Redis Sentinel across three nodes for great fault tolerance.
Platform.sh Professional and lower versions offer Redis in single instance mode only.

### Memcached

[Memcached, a distributed caching solution](http://memcached.org/) is an alternative cache solution, besides using Redis.

See [Memcached Cache Adapter in Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/3.4/components/cache/adapters/memcached_adapter.html#configure-the-connection)
for information on how to configure Memcached.

Example:

``` yaml
services:
    cache.memcached:
        parent: cache.adapter.memcached
        tags:
            - name: cache.pool
              clearer: cache.app_clearer
              provider: 'memcached://user:pass@localhost?weight=33'
```

!!! caution "Connection errors issue"

    If Memcached does display connection errors when using the default (ascii) protocol, then switching to binary protocol *(in the configuration and Memcached daemon)* should resolve the issue.

!!! note

    Memcached must not be bound to the local address if clusters are in use, or user logins will fail.
    To avoid this, in `/etc/memcached.conf` take a look under `# Specify which IP address to listen on. The default is to listen on all IP addresses`

    For development environments, change the address below this comment in `/etc/memcached.conf` to `-l 0.0.0.0`

    For production environments, follow this more secure instruction from the Memcached man:

    > -l &lt;addr&gt;

    > Listen on &lt;addr&gt;; default to INADDR\_ANY. &lt;addr&gt; may be specified as host:port. If you don't specify a port number, the value you specified with -p or -U is used. You may specify multiple addresses separated by comma or by using -l multiple times. This is an important option to consider as there is no other way to secure the installation. Binding to an internal or firewalled network interface is suggested.

## Using Cache Service

Using the internal cache service allows you to use an interface and to not have to care whether the system has been configured to place the cache in Memcached or on File system. And as eZ Platform requires that instances use a cluster-aware cache in Cluster setup, you can safely assume your cache is shared *(and invalidated)* across all web servers.

!!! note

    Current implementation uses a caching library called TagAwareAdapter which implements `Psr\Cache\CacheItemPoolInterface`,
    and therefore is compatible with PSR-6.

!!! caution "Use unique vendor prefix for Cache key"

    When reusing the cache service within your own code, it is very important to not conflict with the cache keys used by others. That is why the example of usage below starts with a unique `myApp` key. For the namespace of your own cache, you must do the same! So never clear cache using the cache service without your key specified, otherwise you'll clear all cache.

#### Get Cache service

##### Via Dependency injection

In your Symfony services configuration you can simply define that you require the "cache" service in your configuration like so:

``` yaml
# yml configuration
    myApp.myService:
        class: %myApp.myService.class%
        arguments:
            - @ezpublish.cache_pool
```

The "cache" service is an instance of `Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\TagAwareAdapter` and implements the `Psr\Cache\CacheItemPoolInterface` interface.

##### Via Symfony Container

Like any other service, it is also possible to get the "cache" service via container like so:

``` php
// Getting the cache service in PHP

/** @var \Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\TagAwareAdapterInterface */
$pool = $container->get('ezpublish.cache_pool');
```

### Using the cache service

Example usage of the cache service:

``` php
// Example
$cacheItem = $pool->getItem("myApp-object-${id}");
if ($cacheItem->isHit()) {
    return $cacheItem->get();
}

$myObject = $container->get('my_app.backend_service')->loadObject($id)
$cacheItem->set($myObject);
$cacheItem->tag(['myApp-category-' . $myObject->categoryId]);
$pool->save($cacheItem);

return $myObject;
```

For more info on usage, take a look at [Symfony Cache's documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/3.4/components/cache.html).

### Clearing Persistence cache

Persistence cache uses a separate Cache Pool decorator which by design prefixes cache keys with "ez\_spi". Clearing persistence cache can thus be done in the following way:

``` php
// To clear all cache (not recommended without a good reason)
$pool->clear();

// To clear a specific cache item (check source for more examples in eZ\Publish\Core\Persistence\Cache\*)
$pool->deleteItems(["ez-content-info-$contentId"]);

// Symfony cache is tag-based, so you can clear all cache related to a Content item like this:
$pool->invalidateTags(["content-$contentId"]);
```
