# Add custom view matcher

In addition to the [built-in view matchers](view_matcher_reference.md),
you can also add custom matchers to use in [template configuration](template_configuration.md#view-rules-and-matching).

To do it, create a matcher class that extends `Ibexa\Core\MVC\Symfony\Matcher\ContentBased\MultipleValued`.

## Matcher class

The matcher class must implement the following methods:

- `matchLocation` - checks if a Location object matches.
- `matchContentInfo` - checks if a ContentInfo object matches.
- `match` - checks if the View object matches.

The following example shows how to implement an `Owner` matcher.
This matcher identifies Content items that have the provided owner or owners.

``` php hl_lines="48"
[[= include_file('code_samples/front/view_matcher/src/View/Matcher/Owner.php') =]]
```

The matcher checks whether the owner of the current content (by its ContentInfo or Location)
matches any of the values passed in configuration (line 48).

## View configuration

To apply the matcher in view configuration, indicate the matcher by its fully qualified class name, preceded by `\`.

The following configuration uses a special template to render articles owned by the users with provided logins:

``` yaml
[[= include_file('code_samples/front/view_matcher/config/packages/views.yaml') =]]
```

!!! note

    If you use a matcher that is a service instead of a simple class,
    tag the service with `ezplatform.view.matcher`.
