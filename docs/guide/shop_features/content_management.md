### Custom product Content Type

`Ez5CatalogDataProvider` defines which Content Type is treated as products and which Field in Product Content items
is treated as SKU:

``` php
const EZ_PRODUCT_CONTENT_TYPE_IDENTIFIER = 'ses_product';
const EZ_PRODUCT_SKU_FIELD_IDENTIFIER = 'ses_sku';
```

If you replace the built-in product with a custom Content Type, you need to replace these constants.

You also need to configure the Content Type to be treated as `createOrderableProductNode`:

``` yaml
parameters.silver_eshop.default.catalog_factory.<content_type_identifier>: createOrderableProductNode
```

## Product variants

A product can have different variants, corresponding for example to different colors or sizes.

You can select and preview variants on the product's page.
Variants can have one or two levels.
When you choose a first attribute, the shop narrows down the options for the second level.

## Product type

A product type represents a collection of very similar products that differ only in some characteristics.
It is used to show a list of products in a tabular way, every product can be added to the basket directly from the overview page.
