# Product management

## Product

[[= product_name_com =]] offers a built-in [Product Content Type](../catalog/product.md).

Any content of this type can be automatically used for all shop functionalities,
such as adding to basket, price calculation and ordering,
and can be embedded on the front end together with quick ordering buttons.

## Product variants

A product can have different variants that correspond, for example, to different colors or sizes.

You can select and preview variants on the product's page.
Variants can have one or two levels.
When you choose the first attribute, the shop narrows down the options for the second level.

## Product type

A product type represents a collection of very similar products that differ only in some characteristics.
It is used to show a list of products in a tabular way, and every product can be added to the basket directly from the overview page.
