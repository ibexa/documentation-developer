# Back Office configuration

## Copy subtree limit

Copying large subtrees can cause performance issues, so you can limit the number of Content items
that can be copied at once using `ezpublish.system.<SiteAccess>.subtree_operations.copy_subtree.limit`
in `parameters.yml`.

The default value is `100`. You can set it to `-1` for no limit,
or to `0` to completely disable copying subtrees.

You can copy subtree from CLI using the command: `bin/console ezplatform:copy-subtree <sourceLocationId> <targetLocationId>`.

## Pagination limits

Default pagination limits for different sections of the Back Office can be defined through respective settings in
[`ezplatform_default_settings.yml`](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui/blob/master/src/bundle/Resources/config/ezplatform_default_settings.yml#L7)

## Default Locations

Default Location IDs for Content structure, Media and Users in the menu are configured using the following settings:

``` yaml
ezpublish:
    system:
        default:
            location_ids:
                content_structure: 2
                media: 43
                users: 5
```

## Notification timeout

To define the timeout for hiding Back-Office notification bars, per notification type,
use the following configuration (times are provided in milliseconds):

``` yaml
ezpublish:
    system:
        admin:
            notifications:
                error:
                    timeout: 0
                warning:
                    timeout: 0
                success:
                    timeout: 5000
                info:
                    timeout: 0
```

The values shown above are the defaults. `0` means the notification does not hide automatically.

## Location for Form-uploaded files

You can use Forms to enable the user to upload files.
The default Location for files uploaded in this way is `/Media/Files/Form Uploads`.
You can change it with the following configuration:

``` yaml
ezpublish:
    system:
        default:
            form_builder:
                upload_location_id: 54
```

This applies only if no specific Location is defined in the Form itself.

## Universal Discovery module limits

Limits for different sections of Universal Discovery Widget module (UDW) can be defined through respective settings in [`universal_discovery_widget.yml`.](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui/blob/master/src/bundle/Resources/config/universal_discovery_widget.yml)
