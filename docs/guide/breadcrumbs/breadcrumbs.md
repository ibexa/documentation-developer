# Breadcrumbs

eZ Commerce automatically generates breadcrumbs for every part of the shop, including the catalog,
internal shop routes (e.g. my profile, search), Content items and forms.

Breadcrumbs are rendered using the `breadcrumb_list.html.twig` template that is called from `pagelayout.html.twig`.

The breadcrumb system uses the [WhiteOctober breadcrumbs bundle](https://github.com/whiteoctober/BreadcrumbsBundle).

## Configuration

You can configure the Fields that will be used as labels for breadcrumb nodes.
The first match wins.

``` yaml
parameters:
    siso_core.default.breadcrumb_content_label_fields: ['name', 'title']
```
