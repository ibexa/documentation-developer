# Basket - Eventlistener in the standard

eZ Commerce offers two standard event listeners.

## StandardBasketListener

The basket comes with a standard event listener which provides a logic for standard rules.

The standard listener provides the following checks:

- check if the quantity is valid for a `catalogElement`
- check for a minimum quantity 
- check for a maximum quantity
- check the packaging unit
- purges the basket cache after changes in the basket

#### Allowed quantity

The allowed quantity is stored in `catalogElement` as a regex - `$allowedQuantity` - and is evaluated by `preg_match()`.

!!! note

    If the [catalog factory](../../../data_providers/content_model_dataprovider.md) did not set the `$allowedQuantity` attribute in the catalog element, only `int` quantity is valid.

#### Min and max quantity

The min and max values are stored in `EshopBundle/Resources/config/basket.yml` as a *default*, if not set in `catalogElement` as `$minOrderQuantity` and `$maxOrderQuantity`.

``` yaml
parameters:
    silver_basket.basketline_quantity_max: 99
    silver_basket.basketline_quantity_min: 1
```

#### Packaging unit

The packaging unit is stored in `catalogElement` as `packagingUnit`. If the requested quantity does not correspond to the packaging unit, the quantity is increased to the next possible quantity that will correspond to the packaging unit.

## DiscontinuedProductsListener

This listener handles discontinued products. It is active when it's enabled in configuration:

!!! tip "How to enable/disable this listener?"

    parameters:

    ``` yaml
    #here you can enable/disable the DiscontinuedProductsListener
    #values: true or false
    siso_basket.default.discontinued_products_listener_active: true
    ```

### When is a catalog element recognized as discontinued?

This listener is only active for products that are marked as 'discontinued'

``` php
$catalogElement.dataMap.discontinued = new TextLineField(array('text' => 1));
```

### Logic

There are three possibilities when a listener checks stock information:

- stock is not available - error message is displayed that there is no information about the availability for product, but it is discontinued.
- stock is 0 - item is removed from the basket and error message is displayed that the item is discontinued and not available anymore.
- ordered quantity is bigger than stock - the quantity is modified in the basket line and notice message is set in the basket.
