# Content Repository configuration

You can define several Repositories within a single application. However, you can only use one per site.

## Repository connection

### Using default values

To use the default Repository connection, you do not need to specify its details:

``` yaml
ezpublish:
    repositories:
        # Defining Repository with alias "main"
        # Default storage engine is used, with default connection
        # Equals to:
        # main: { storage: { engine: legacy, connection: <defaultConnectionName> } }
        main: ~
```

!!! note "Legacy storage engine"

    Legacy storage engine is the default storage engine for the Repository.

    It uses [Doctrine DBAL](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/) (Database Abstraction Layer).
    Database settings are supplied by [DoctrineBundle](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineBundle).
    As such, you can refer to [DoctrineBundle's documentation](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/configuration.rst#doctrine-dbal-configuration).

If no Repository is specified for a SiteAccess or SiteAccess group,
the first Repository defined under `ezpublish.repositories` will be used:

``` yaml
ezpublish:
    repositories:
        main: ~
    system:
        # All members of site_group will use "main" Repository
        # No need to set "repository", it will take the first defined Repository by default
        site_group:
            # ...
```

### Defining custom connection

You can also explicitly define a custom Repository connection:

``` yaml
doctrine:
    dbal:
        default_connection: my_connection_name
        connections:
            my_connection_name:
                driver:   pdo_mysql
                host:     localhost
                port:     3306
                dbname:   my_database
                user:     my_user
                password: my_password
                charset:  UTF8MB4

            another_connection_name:
                # ...

ezpublish:
    repositories:
        first_repository: { storage: { engine: legacy, connection: my_connection_name, config: {} } }
        second_repository: { storage: { engine: legacy, connection: another_connection_name, config: {} } }

    # ...

    system:
        my_first_siteaccess:
            repository: first_repository

        my_second_siteaccess:
            repository: second_repository
```

## Field groups configuration

Field groups, used in content and Content Type editing, can be configured under the `repositories` key.
Values entered there are Field group *identifiers*:

``` yaml
repositories:
    default:
        fields_groups:
            list: [content, features, metadata]
            default: content
```

These identifiers can be given human-readable values and can be translated. Those values are used when editing Content Types.
The translation domain isÂ `ezplatform_fields_groups`.
This example in `app/Resources/translations/ezplatform_fields_groups.en.yml` defines English names for Field groups:

``` yaml
content: Content
metadata: Metadata
user_data: User data
```

## Limit of archived Content item versions

`default_version_archive_limit` controls the number of archived versions per Content item that are stored in the Repository.
By default it is set to 5. This setting is configured in the following way (typically in `ezplatform.yml`):

``` yaml
ezpublish:
    repositories:
        default:
            options:
                default_version_archive_limit: 10
```

This limit is enforced on publishing a new version and only covers archived versions, not drafts.

!!! tip

    Don't set `default_version_archive_limit` too high.
    In Legacy storage engine you will see performance degradation if you store too many versions.
    The default value of 5 is the recommended value, but the less content you have overall,
    the more you can increase this to, for instance, 25 or even 50.

### Removing old versions

You can use the `ezplatform:content:cleanup-versions` command to remove old content versions.

The command takes the following optional parameters:

- `status` or `t` - status of versions to remove: `draft`, `archived` or `all`
- `keep` or `k` - number of versions to keep
- `user` or `u` - the User that the command will be performed as. The User must have the `content/remove`, `content/read` and `content/versionread` Policies. By default the `administrator` user is applied.

`ezplatform:content:cleanup-versions --status <status name> --keep <number of versions> --user <user name>`

For example, the following command removes archived versions as user `admin`, but leaves the 5 most recent versions:

`ezplatform:content:cleanup-versions --status archived --keep 5 --user administrator`

## User identifiers

`ezplatform_default_settings.yml` contains two settings that indicate which Content Types are treated like users and user groups:

``` yaml
ezpublish:
    system:
        default:
            user_content_type_identifier: [user]
            user_group_content_type_identifier: [user_group]
```

You can override these settings if you have other Content Types that should be treated as users/user groups in the Back Office.
When viewing such Content in the Back Office you will be able to see e.g. the assigned Policies.
