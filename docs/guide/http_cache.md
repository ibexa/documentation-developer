# HTTP Cache

## Introduction

### Smart HTTP cache clearing

**Smart HTTP cache clearing** refers to the ability to clear cache for Locations/content that is in relation with the content being currently cleared.

When published, any Content item usually has at least one Location, identified by its URL. Therefore, HTTP cache being bound to URLs, if a Content item is updated (a new version is published), we want HTTP cache for all its Locations to be cleared, so the content itself can be updated everywhere it is supposed to be displayed. Sometimes, clearing cache for the content's Locations is not sufficient. You can, for instance, have an excerpt of it displayed in a list from the parent Location, or from within a relation. In this case, cache for the parent Location and/or the relation need to be cleared as well (at least if an ESI is not used).

#### The mechanism

**Smart HTTP cache clearing** is an event-based mechanism. Whenever a content item needs its cache cleared, the cache purger service sends an `ezpublish.cache_clear.content` event (also identified by `eZ\Publish\Core\MVC\Symfony\MVCEvents::CACHE_CLEAR_CONTENT` constant) and passes an `eZ\Publish\Core\MVC\Symfony\Event\ContentCacheClearEvent` event object. This object contains the ContentInfo object we need to clear the cache for. Every listener for this event can add Location objects to the *cache clear list*.

Once the event is dispatched, the purger passes collected Location objects to the purge client, which will effectively send the cache `BAN` request.

!!! note

    The event is dispatched with a dedicated event dispatcher, `ezpublish.http_cache.event_dispatcher`.

#### Default behavior

By default, following Locations will be added to the cache clear list:

- All Locations assigned to content (`AssignedLocationsListener`)
- Parent Location of all Content item's Locations (`ParentLocationsListener`)
- Locations for content's relations, including reverse relations (`RelatedLocationsListener`)

#### Implementing a custom listener

By design, smart HTTP cache clearing is extensible. One can easily implement an event listener/subscriber to the `ezpublish.cache_clear.content` event and add Locations to the cache clear list.

##### Example

Here's a very simple custom listener example, adding an arbitrary Location to the list.

!!! note "Important"

    Cache clear listener services **must** be tagged as `ezpublish.http_cache.event_subscriber` or `ezpublish.http_cache.event_listener`.

``` php
namespace Acme\AcmeTestBundle\EventListener;

use eZ\Publish\API\Repository\LocationService;
use eZ\Publish\Core\MVC\Symfony\Event\ContentCacheClearEvent;
use eZ\Publish\Core\MVC\Symfony\MVCEvents;
use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;

class ArbitraryLocationsListener implements EventSubscriberInterface
{
    /**
     * @var LocationService
     */
    private $locationService;

    public function __construct( LocationService $locationService )
    {
        $this->locationService = $locationService;
    }

    public static function getSubscribedEvents()
    {
        return [MVCEvents::CACHE_CLEAR_CONTENT => ['onContentCacheClear', 100]];
    }

    public function onContentCacheClear( ContentCacheClearEvent $event )
    {
        // $contentInfo is the ContentInfo object for the content being cleared.
        // You can extract information from it (e.g. ContentType from its contentTypeId), using appropriate Repository services.
        $contentInfo = $event->getContentInfo();

        // Adding arbitrary locations to the cache clear list.
        $event->addLocationToClear( $this->locationService->loadLocation( 123 ) );
        $event->addLocationToClear( $this->locationService->loadLocation( 456 ) );
    }
}
```

``` php
parameters:
    acme.cache_clear.arbitrary_locations_listener.class: Acme\AcmeTestBundle\EventListener\ArbitraryLocationsListener

services:
    acme.cache_clear.arbitrary_locations_listener:
        class: %acme.cache_clear.arbitrary_locations_listener.class%
        arguments: [@ezpublish.api.service.location]
        tags:
            - { name: ezpublish.http_cache.event_subscriber }
```

### Content Cache

eZ Platform uses [Symfony HttpCache](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/http_cache.html) to manage content "view" cache with an [expiration model](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/http_cache.html#http-expiration-and-validation). In addition it is extended *(using FOSHttpCache)* to add several advanced features. For content coming from the CMS the following is taken advantage of out of the box:

- To be able to always keep cache up to date, cache is made "content-aware" to allow updates to content to trigger *cache invalidation.*
    - Uses a custom `X-Location-Id` header, which both Symfony and Varnish Proxy are able to invalidate cache on *(for details see [Cache purge](#cache-purge).)*
- To be able to also cache requests by logged-in users, cache is made "[context-aware](#context-aware-http-cache)."
    - Uses a custom vary header `X-User-Hash` to allow pages to var by user rights *(so not per unique user, that is better served by browser cache.)*

#### Cache and Expiration Configuration

``` yaml
# ezplatform.yml
ezpublish:
    system:
        my_siteaccess:
            content:
                view_cache: true      # Activates HttpCache for content
                ttl_cache: true       # Activates expiration based HttpCache for content (very fast)
                default_ttl: 60       # Number of seconds an Http response cache is valid (if ttl_cache is true, and if no custom s-maxage is set)
```

##### Cache and Expiration Configuration for error pages

It is normal to want to set the `default_ttl` setting above high to have a high cache hit ratio on your installation. As the system takes care of purges, the cache rarely becomes stale.

However, a few redirect and error pages are served via the ContentView system, and if you do set a high `default_ttl`, you should make sure to set those pages to a much lower ttl to avoid issues caused by that. For this you can use the [FOSHttpCacheBundle matching rules](http://foshttpcachebundle.readthedocs.io/en/1.3/reference/configuration/headers.html) feature to specify a different ttl time:

``` yaml
fos_http_cache:
    cache_control:
        rules:
            # Make sure cacheable (fresh) responses from eZ Platform which are errors/redirects gets lower ttl than default_ttl
            -
                match:
                    match_response: "response.isFresh() && ( response.isServerError() || response.isClientError() || response.isRedirect() )"
                headers:
                    overwrite: true
                    cache_control:
                        max_age: 5
                        s_maxage: 20
```

Similarly, if you want to apply performance tuning to avoid crawlers affecting the setup too much, you can also set up caching of generic 404's and similar error pages in the following way:

``` yaml
fos_http_cache:
    cache_control:
        rules:
            # Example of performance tuning, force TTL on 404 pages to avoid crawlers, etc., taking too much load
            # Should not be set too high, as cached 404's can cause issues for future routes, URL aliases, wildcards, etc.
            -
                match:
                    match_response: "!response.isFresh() && response.isNotFound()"
                headers:
                    overwrite: true
                    cache_control:
                        public: true
                        max_age: 0
                        s_maxage: 20
```


#### Making your controller response content-aware

Sometimes you need your controller's cache to be invalidated at the same time as specific content changes (i.e. [ESI sub-requests with `render` twig helper](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/http_cache.html#using-esi-in-symfony2), for a menu for instance). To be able to do that, you just need to add `X-Location-Id` header to the response object:

``` php
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;
 
// Inside a controller action
// "Connects" the response to location #123 and sets a max age (TTL) of 1 hour.
$response = new Response();
$response->headers->set('X-Location-Id', 123);
$response->setSharedMaxAge(3600);
```

#### Making your controller response context-aware

If the content you're rendering depends on a user's permissions, then you should make the response context-aware:

``` php
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;
 
// Inside a controller action
// Tells proxy configured to support this header to take the rights of a user (user hash) into account for the cache
$response = new Response();
$response->setVary('X-User-Hash');
```

## Configuration

### Cache Purge

This page explains the content cache purge *(aka invalidate)* mechanism used when publishing content from the UI or from a container-aware script, resulting in cache being invalidated either in the built-in Symfony Reverse Proxy, or on the much faster Varnish reverse proxy.

Note that if you use a non-reverse proxy that does not support purge headers, shared content will stay in the cache for the whole duration defined by s-maxage, without the possibility of clearing it.

#### Overview

eZ Platform returns content-related responses with an `X-Location-Id` header that are stored together by the configured HTTP cache. This allows you to clear *(invalidate)* HTTP cache representing specifically a given Content item. On publishing the content, a cache purger is triggered with the Content ID in question, which in turn figures out affected content Locations based on [Smart HTTP cache clearing](#smart-http-cache-clearing) logic. The returned Location IDs are sent for purge using the purge type explained further below.

#### Purge types

##### Symfony Proxy: Local purge type

By default, invalidation requests will be emulated and sent to the Symfony Proxy cache Store. Cache purge will thus be synchronous, meaning no HTTP purge requests will be sent around when publishing.

``` yaml
# ezplatform.yml
ezpublish:
    http_cache:
        purge_type: local
```

#### Varnish: HTTP purge type

With Varnish you can configure one or several servers that should be purged over HTTP. This purge type is asynchronous, and flushed by the end of Symfony kernel-request/console cycle *(during terminate event)*. Settings for purge servers can be configured per site group or site access:

``` yaml
# ezplatform.yml
ezpublish:
    http_cache:
        purge_type: http

    system:
        my_siteacess:
            http_cache:
                purge_servers: ["http://varnish.server1", "http://varnish.server2", "http://varnish.server3"]
```

For further information on setting up Varnish, see [Using Varnish](#using-varnish).

#### Purging

While purging on content, updates are handled for you; on actions against the eZ Platform APIs, there are times you might have to purge manually.

##### Manual by code

Manual purging from code which takes [Smart HTTP cache clearing](#smart-http-cache-clearing) logic into account, this is using the service also used internally for cache clearing on content updates:

``` yaml
// Purging cache based on content id, this will trigger cache clear of all locations found by Smart HttpCache clear
// typically self, parent, related, ..
$container->get('ezpublish.http_cache.purger')->purgeForContent(55);
```

##### Manually by command with Symfony Proxy

Symfony Proxy stores its cache in the Symfony cache directory, so a regular `cache:clear` commands will clear it:

``` bash
php app/console --env=prod cache:clear
```

##### Manual by HTTP BAN request on Varnish

When using Varnish and in need to purge content directly, then the following examples show how this is done internally by our FOSPurgeClient, and in turn FOSHttpCache Varnish proxy client:

For purging all:

```
BAN / HTTP 1.1
Host: localhost
X-Location-Id: .*
```

Or with given location ids *(here 123 and 234)*: 

```
BAN / HTTP 1.1
Host: localhost
X-Location-Id: ^(123|234)$
```

### Using Varnish

eZ Platform being built on top of Symfony, it uses standard HTTP cache headers. By default the Symfony reverse proxy, written in PHP, is used to handle cache, but it can be easily replaced with any other reverse proxy like Varnish.

*Use of Varnish is a requirement for use in Clustering setup, for overview of clustering feature see [Clustering](clustering.md).*

### Prerequisites

- A working Varnish 3 or Varnish 4 setup.

### Recommended VCL base files

For Varnish to work properly with eZ, you'll need to use one of the provided files as a basis:

- [Varnish 3 VCL example](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/blob/master/doc/varnish/vcl/varnish3.vcl)
- [Varnish 4 VCL example](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/blob/master/doc/varnish/vcl/varnish4.vcl)

!!! note

    Http cache management is done with the help of [FOSHttpCacheBundle](http://foshttpcachebundle.readthedocs.org/). You may need to tweak your VCL further on according to [FOSHttpCache documentation](http://foshttpcache.readthedocs.org/en/latest/varnish-configuration.html) in order to use features supported by it.

#### Configure eZ Publish

##### Update your Virtual Host

Somehow we need to tell php process that we are behind a Varnish proxy and not the built in Symfony Http Proxy. If you use fastcgi/fpm you can pass these directly to php process, but you can in all cases also specify them in your web server config.

##### On apache:

```
# my_virtualhost.conf

<VirthualHost *:80>
    # Configure your VirtualHost with rewrite rules and stuff
 
    # Force front controller NOT to use built-in reverse proxy.
    SetEnv SYMFONY_HTTP_CACHE 0
 
    # Configure IP of your Varnish server to be trusted proxy
    # Replace fake IP address below by your Varnish IP address
    SetEnv SYMFONY_TRUSTED_PROXIES "193.22.44.22"
</VirtualHost>
```

##### On nginx:

```
# mysite.com

fastcgi_param SYMFONY_HTTP_CACHE 0;
# Configure IP of your Varnish server to be trusted proxy
# Replace fake IP address below by your Varnish IP address
fastcgi_param SYMFONY_TRUSTED_PROXIES "193.22.44.22";
```

#### Update YML configuration

Secondly we need to tell eZ Platform to change to use http based purge client *(specifically FosHttpCache Varnish purge client is used)*, and specify url Varnish can be reached on:

``` yaml
# ezplatform.yml

ezpublish:
    http_cache:
        purge_type: http
 
    system:
        # Assuming that my_siteaccess_group your frontend AND backend siteaccesses
        my_siteaccess_group:
            http_cache:
                # Fill in your Varnish server(s) address(es).
                purge_servers: [http://my.varnish.server:8081]
```

## Usage

### Context-aware HTTP cache

#### Use case

As it is based on Symfony 2, eZ Platform uses HTTP cache extended with features like content awareness. However, this cache management is only available for anonymous users due to HTTP restrictions.

It is of course possible to make HTTP cache vary thanks to the `Vary` response header, but this header can only be based on one of the request headers (e.g. `Accept-Encoding`). Thus, to make the cache vary on a specific context *(for example a hash based on a user roles and limitations)*, this context must be present in the original request.

#### Feature

As the response can vary on a request header, the base solution is to make the kernel do a sub-request in order to retrieve the user context hash (aka **user hash**). Once the *user hash* has been retrieved, it's injected in the original request in the `X-User-Hash` custom header, making it possible to *vary* the HTTP response on this header:

``` php
<?php
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

// ...

// Inside a controller action
$response = new Response();
$response->setVary('X-User-Hash');
```

This solution is implemented in Symfony reverse proxy (aka *HttpCache*) and is also accessible to dedicated reverse proxies like Varnish.

!!! note

    Note that sharing ESIs across SiteAccesses is not possible by design (see [![](https://jira.ez.no/images/icons/issuetypes/bug.png)EZP-22535](https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-22535?src=confmacro) - Cached ESI can not be shared across pages/siteaccesses due to "pathinfo" property Closed for technical details)

!!! tip "Vary by User"

    In cases where you need to deliver content uniquely to a given user, and tricks like using JavaScript and cookie values, hinclude, or disabling cache is not an option. Then remaining option is to vary response by cookie:

    ``` php
    $response->setVary('Cookie');
    ```

    Unfortunately this is not optimal as it will by default vary by all cookies, including those set by add trackers, analytics tools, recommendation services, etc. However, as long as *your* application backend does not need these cookies, you can solve this by stripping everything but the session cookie. Example for Varnish can be found in the default VCL examples in part dealing with User Hash, for single-server setup this can easily be accomplished in Apache / Nginx as well.

#### HTTP cache clear

As eZ Platform uses [FOSHttpCacheBundle](http://foshttpcachebundle.readthedocs.org/), this impacts the following features:

- HTTP cache purge
- User context hash

Varnish proxy client from FOSHttpCache lib is used for clearing eZ HTTP cache, even when using Symfony HttpCache. A single `BAN` request is sent to registered purge servers, containing a `X-Location-Id` header. This header contains all Location IDs for which objects in cache need to be cleared.

#### Symfony reverse proxy

Symfony reverse proxy (aka HttpCache) is supported out of the box, all you have to do is to activate it.

#### Varnish

Please refer to [Using Varnish](#using-varnish)

#### User context hash

[FOSHttpCacheBundle *User Context feature*](http://foshttpcachebundle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/features/user-context.html) is activated by default.

As the response can vary on a request header, the base solution is to make the kernel do a sub-request in order to retrieve the context (aka **user context hash**). Once the *user hash* has been retrieved, it's injected in the original request in the `X-User-Hash` header, making it possible to *vary* the HTTP response on this header:

Name of the [user hash header is configurable in FOSHttpCacheBundle](http://foshttpcachebundle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/configuration/user-context.html). By default eZ Platform sets it to `**X-User-Hash**`.

``` php
<?php
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

// ...

// Inside a controller action
$response = new Response();
$response->setVary('X-User-Hash');
```

This solution is [implemented in Symfony reverse proxy (aka *HttpCache*)](http://foshttpcachebundle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/features/symfony-http-cache.html) and is also accessible to [dedicated reverse proxies like Varnish](http://foshttpcache.readthedocs.org/en/latest/varnish-configuration.html).

#### Workflow

Please refer to [FOSHttpCacheBundle documentation on how user context feature works](http://foshttpcachebundle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/features/user-context.html#how-it-works).

#### User hash generation

Please refer to [FOSHttpCacheBundle documentation on how user hashes are being generated](http://foshttpcachebundle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/features/user-context.html#generating-hashes).

eZ Platform already interferes with the hash generation process by adding current user permissions and limitations. You can also interfere in this process by [implementing custom context provider(s)](http://foshttpcachebundle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/configuration/user-context.html#custom-context-providers).

##### User hash generation with Varnish 3

The behavior described here comes out of the box with Symfony reverse proxy, but it's of course possible to use Varnish to achieve the same.

```
# Varnish 3 style for eZ Platform
# Our Backend - We assume that eZ Platform Web server listen on port 80 on the same machine.

    set req.backend = ezplatform;

    # ...

    call ez_user_hash;

    # If it passes all these tests, do a lookup anyway;

        }
    }

        unset req.http.x-fos-original-cookie;

        # Force the lookup, the backend must tell not to cache or vary on the
        # user hash to properly separate cached data.

        return (lookup);
    }
}

sub vcl_fetch {

    # ...

        remove resp.http.Vary;
    }

##### New anonymous X-User-Hash

The anonymous X-User-Hash is generated based on the *anonymous user*, *group* and *role*. The `38015b703d82206ebc01d17a39c727e5` hash that is provided in the code above will work only when these three variables are left unchanged. Once you change the default permissions and settings, the X-User-Hash will change and Varnish won't be able to effectively handle cache anymore.

In that case you need to find out the new anonymous X-User-Hash and change the VCL accordingly, else Varnish will return a no-cache header.

The easiest way to find the new hash is:

**1.** Connect to your server (*shh* should be enough)

**2.** Add `<your-domain.com>` to your `/etc/hosts` file

**3.** Execute the following command:

`curl -I -H "Accept: application/vnd.fos.user-context-hash" http://<your-domain.com>/_fos_user_context_hash`

Please, remember that you have to send this request to the backend, not to Varnish.

You should get a result like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 03 Oct 2016 15:34:08 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
X-Powered-By: PHP/7.0.8-0ubuntu0.16.04.2
X-User-Hash: b1731d46b0e7a375a5b024e950fdb8d49dd25af85a5c7dd5116ad2a18cda82cb
Cache-Control: max-age=600, public
Vary: Cookie,Authorization
Content-Type: application/vnd.fos.user-context-hash
```

**4.** Now, replace the existing X-User-Hash value with the new one:

```
# Note: This needs update every time anonymous user role assignments change.
set req.http.X-User-Hash = "b1731d46b0e7a375a5b024e950fdb8d49dd25af85a5c7dd5116ad2a18cda82cb";
```

**5.** Restart the Varnish server and everything should work fine.

##### Known limitations of the user hash generation

A few limitations are known:

* If you are using uri-based SiteAccesses matching, the default SiteAccess on the domain needs to point to the same repository, because `/_fos_user_context_hash` is not SiteAccess-aware by default (see `ezpublish.default_router.non_siteaccess_aware_routes` parameter). Varnish does not have knowledge about SiteAccesses, so it won't be able to get user content hash if the default siteaccess relies on URI.  

##### Default options for FOSHttpCacheBundle defined in eZ

The following configuration is defined in eZ by default for FOSHttpCacheBundle. You may override these settings.

``` yaml
fos_http_cache:
    proxy_client:
        # "varnish" is used, even when using Symfony HttpCache.
        default: varnish
        varnish:
            # Means http_cache.purge_servers defined for current SiteAccess.
            servers: [$http_cache.purge_servers$]

    user_context:
        enabled: true
        # User context hash is cached during 10min
        hash_cache_ttl: 600
        user_hash_header: X-User-Hash
```
