# MatchNone Criterion

The [`MatchNone` URL Criterion](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-kernel/blob/v1.0.0/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/URL/Query/Criterion/MatchNone.php)
is an auxiliary Criterion that returns no search results.
It is used internally when no filter or query is provided on a Query object.

The Criterion takes no arguments.
