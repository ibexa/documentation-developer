# Trainings

TODO: Introduction to trainings

## Learning path

Each training starts with a list of the trainings you should previously master before going into the selected one.

If you're new to Ibexa DXP, your first training is _[The early training title](docs/trainings/a_training_topic/an_early_training/000_syllabus.md)_.

## Training environment

You need a running instance of Ibexa DXP to take a training.

Each training starts with its technical requirements.
Some trainings provide some additional set-up (such as code, content, or config) to install before starting the training.

You can use whatever solution that suits you to run an Ibexa DXP in the required edition for your training.
You'll need to access the Ibexa DXP code, the servers' configs, and command lines.

[DDEV](install_with_ddev.md) can be used to build such training installation.
